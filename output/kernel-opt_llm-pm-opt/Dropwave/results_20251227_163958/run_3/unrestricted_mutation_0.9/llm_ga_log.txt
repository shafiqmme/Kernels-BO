  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ * SE)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the squared exponential kernel with the sum of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels. The multiplication with SE is intended to maintain smoothness while the addition of PER and RQ captures periodicity and varying length scales. This combination leverages the strengths of the periodic behavior and the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML based on the observed data characteristics.
  Result: (SE * (PER + RQ))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:

Analysis: By changing the multiplication of SE with the sum of PER and RQ to an addition of SE with the product of PER and RQ, we allow the model to capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the more complex structure introduced by the combination of periodicity and rational quadratic behavior. This may improve the model's flexibility and ability to fit the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + (RQ * SE)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel while maintaining the smoothness of the SE kernel. By multiplying SE with the sum of PER and a scaled version of RQ (RQ * SE), we aim to capture both periodic structures and varying length scales. This construction leverages the strengths from both parent kernels while introducing a new interaction term that may improve the overall fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by utilizing a multiplication of the SE kernel with both the PER and RQ kernels. The multiplication captures the interactions between the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodicity of the PER kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This composite kernel is expected to enhance the model's ability to fit the data by leveraging different characteristics from both parents, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the addition of the original combination from Parent 1 and introducing a new interaction term from Parent 2. The term (SE * (PER * RQ)) allows for periodic behavior influenced by the rational quadratic characteristics, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data. The addition of these components may enhance flexibility and improve the fit, potentially yielding a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By replacing the multiplication of SE with the sum of SE and the product of PER and RQ, we allow for a more flexible interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components. This combination can capture both smooth trends and periodic variations in the data more effectively, potentially improving the LML score by accommodating varying levels of smoothness and periodicity.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of PER with the smoothness of SE through multiplication, allowing for complex patterns while retaining the ability to model smooth variations. Adding RQ captures additional flexibility in modeling varying scales of data, which could potentially improve the LML by providing a richer representation of the underlying function compared to both parent kernels. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while addressing their limitations.
  Result: (SE * PER) + RQ... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of the periodic kernel (PER) and rational quadratic kernel (RQ) to an addition with the squared exponential (SE), we allow the model to capture both smooth variations from the SE kernel and periodic fluctuations from the combination of PER and RQ. This modification can better account for variations in the data, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE * PER) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity captured by (SE * PER) with the flexibility of (SE * RQ), while also incorporating RQ independently. By adding RQ to the mix, we allow for additional flexibility in modeling, which may help in capturing variations in the data that are not fully addressed by the other terms alone. This combination has the potential to improve the log marginal likelihood by leveraging the strengths of all components.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ... LML=-1.290

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + (SE * SE)
Analysis: By adding an additional term of (SE * SE), we are introducing a stronger influence of the squared exponential kernel, which can help capture smoothness in the data more effectively. The combination of (SE * PER) captures periodic behavior, while (SE * RQ) allows for varying smoothness. The new term (SE * SE) strengthens the overall model's capability to fit the underlying data patterns, which may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + (SE * SE)... LML=-1.290

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + (RQ * SE) + (SE * (RQ * SE)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior captured by (SE * PER) from Parent 2 with the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel through (RQ * SE) and incorporates the structure of Parent 1 by including the term (SE * (RQ * SE)). The aim is to leverage the strengths of both kernels to allow for complex variations in the data while maintaining smoothness and periodicity, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((SE * PER) + (RQ * SE) + (SE * (RQ * SE)))... LML=-1.290

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: By removing the RQ term, we simplify the kernel while maintaining the multiplicative combination of SE with both PER and RQ. This focuses on the interactions between the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodicity of the PER kernel, which could improve the fit to the data by emphasizing the relevant features while reducing complexity that might be caused by the additional RQ kernel. This simplification may lead to a higher LML since it avoids potential overfitting while retaining key interactions.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of Parent 2, which effectively utilizes the periodic and rational quadratic components together, with the additive component from Parent 1 that enhances the contribution of the rational quadratic kernel. By maintaining the interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic kernels while adding the contribution of the squared exponential with rational quadratic, this expression aims to capture both periodic and smooth variations in the data more effectively, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * RQ)... LML=-1.290

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: By increasing the weight of the Rational Quadratic kernel in the combination, we can improve the flexibility of the model to capture varying smoothness in the data. The addition of another (SE * RQ) term may help in better modeling the variance and capturing more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to an increase in the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction between the SE and PER kernels from Parent 2 with the additive interaction involving RQ from Parent 1. By introducing RQ in an additive manner alongside PER, we aim to capture both periodic and varying smoothness, potentially improving the flexibility and expressiveness of the model, which may lead to a higher LML score.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-4946.334
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: By removing the SE * PER term, we reduce potential interference from the periodic component, which may not be fitting the data well. Instead, we maintain the interaction between the SE and RQ kernels, enhancing flexibility in capturing varying length scales, while adding PER separately allows for periodicity to be modeled independently. This modification may help improve the model's fit and potentially increase the LML.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + PER... LML=-2.612

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic characteristics of PER with the smoothness of SE, while also leveraging the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding (RQ * SE), we introduce additional variability that captures a wider range of behaviors in the data without losing the benefits of the SE and PER kernels. This combination is likely to enhance the model's ability to fit the observed data and potentially improve the LML.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)... LML=-1.290

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: By removing the SE * PER term and replacing it with PER * RQ, we combine the periodic behavior with the rational quadratic kernel, which can help in capturing more complex patterns in the data. The multiplication of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels may allow for greater flexibility and adaptability to the underlying data structure, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)) * RQ  
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by retaining the product of the SE and PER from Parent 1, while incorporating the RQ component from both parent kernels. The multiplication by RQ aims to enhance the flexibility of the model by allowing for variations that capture both the smoothness of the SE and the periodic nature of the PER, along with the capability to model varying length scales from RQ. This combination could potentially increase the log marginal likelihood by leveraging the best features of each kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the smoothness of SE and the flexibility of RQ. By adding a product of SE and the interaction of RQ with PER, it captures both periodic fluctuations and varying lengths of correlations, which may enhance the model's ability to fit the observed data, thus potentially increasing the LML.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of SE and PER from Parent 2 with the multiplicative relationship of RQ and SE from Parent 1. By allowing RQ to modulate the periodic behavior of PER within the context of SE, it aims to capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodic variations introduced by PER, potentially yielding a better fit to the observed data and improving the log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic and rational quadratic components effectively. By adding the interaction between SE and the sum of PER and RQ, we maintain the flexibility of the periodicity while also leveraging the smoothness properties of the rational quadratic. The additional term (SE * (RQ * PER)) introduces an interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic behaviors, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data. This new structure aims to benefit from the strengths of both parent kernels while promoting a more robust fit to the observed data, possibly leading to a higher LML.

This may enhance the flexibility of the model and improve the fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood. Additionally, combining PER with RQ could help model variations that are both periodic and varying in length scale, benefiting from the rational quadratic's ability to capture varying smoothness.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by maintaining the interaction between the squared exponential and periodic components while also incorporating the rational quadratic kernel in a multiplicative manner. By adding (RQ + PER) as a multiplicative factor, the model can capture both periodic patterns and varying smoothness, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: The parent kernels already show a good fit with an LML of -1.290. By retaining the combination from Parent 1, we maintain the interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components while leveraging the squared exponential’s smoothness. Since both parents yield the same LML score, this expression consolidates their strengths without introducing potential conflicts from unnecessary complexity. It’s also worth noting that maintaining the original combination may stabilize the LML, as modifications can lead to lower performance.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the SE kernel with both the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) components, similar to the strengths of both parents. By using the addition of PER and RQ within the multiplication with SE, it allows for capturing both periodic and varying length-scale behaviors in the data. Additionally, by adding a term that includes SE and PER, it ensures that the model retains the periodic characteristics while emphasizing the contribution of the RQ kernel, which can help achieve a better fit and potentially increase the LML.
  Result: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * PER)... LML=-4946.331

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * PER  
Analysis: The current kernel combines a product of the SE and PER kernels with a product of RQ kernels, which may lead to limitations in capturing the underlying structure of the data. By replacing the multiplication of RQ with an addition of SE and RQ, and then multiplying by the periodic kernel PER, we introduce more flexibility and the ability to model both smooth variations (from SE and RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER) effectively. This can potentially enhance the LML by better fitting the observed data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the existing elements of Parent 1 with an additional term that captures the interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components. By including the term (PER * RQ), we introduce a mixed behavior that may allow for better modeling of data with both periodic and varying scale characteristics, potentially enhancing the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * PER
Analysis: By combining the SE kernel with RQ, we can introduce flexibility in the model to account for varying smoothness in the data, while still capturing periodicity with the PER kernel. This formulation might better capture the underlying structure of the data, potentially leading to a higher LML score than the current kernel setup. The addition of the SE kernel provides a smooth component while the multiplication with PER maintains periodicity, which could improve the overall fit.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with the periodic and rational quadratic components, while also including a term that captures the interaction of SE with PER multiplied by RQ. By leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels, this expression aims to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the model to the observed data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood.

By adding SE and RQ, we can capture both local variations and long-range dependencies. Multiplying this sum by PER allows for the modeling of periodic patterns in the data. This combination may lead to a better fit and an increase in the log marginal likelihood compared to the original kernel.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel while also leveraging the flexibility of the RQ kernel. The term (SE * PER) captures interactions where both periodicity and smoothness are important, while the term (SE * (RQ * SE)) allows for variations that account for non-stationary behavior. This combination aims to enhance the fit to the data by integrating the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.
