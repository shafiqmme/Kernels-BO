Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((SE + SE) + PER) (LML: -2.612)
  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ * SE)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the smoothness of SE and the flexibility of RQ. By multiplying SE with PER, we allow for smooth variations that respect the periodic structure, while adding the product of RQ and SE provides additional flexibility to model varying scales of smoothness. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a higher LML by capturing both global trends and periodic patterns effectively.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * PER  
Analysis: By combining the SE and RQ kernels with addition before multiplying by the periodic kernel (PER), we increase the flexibility of the model to capture both smooth variations (from SE) and non-stationary behavior (from RQ), while still leveraging the periodic nature of the data (from PER). This modification can help improve the fit to the data and potentially increase the LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the smoothness of SE and RQ. By using the product (SE * PER), it allows for capturing both the smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data. The addition of the term (RQ * (SE * PER)) introduces further flexibility, leveraging the strengths of RQ to model varying smoothness while maintaining the periodic characteristics. This combination aims to enhance the fit over both parent kernels by capturing both periodic patterns and different levels of smoothness.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction between the squared exponential (SE) and the periodic (PER) kernel with the additional contribution of the rational quadratic (RQ) kernel multiplied by the SE kernel. It maintains the structure of Parent 1, which already showed a competitive LML score. By focusing on the combination of SE and PER together with RQ, this expression aims to leverage the strengths of periodicity and smoothness, potentially improving the fit on the observed data. Since both parents had the same LML, this kernel maintains a similar complexity while exploring a combination that might provide better coverage of the underlying function.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This kernel expression retains the combination of the first parent, which includes a product of the squared exponential and periodic kernels along with a product of the rational quadratic and squared exponential kernels. By maintaining this structure, we preserve the advantages of both components, allowing for smooth variations and periodic behaviors while having the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel. This combination may enhance the model's ability to capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER)
Analysis: The Squared Exponential (SE) kernel captures smoothness well, while the Periodic (PER) kernel adds the ability to model periodic patterns in the data. By multiplying these two kernels, we can enhance the flexibility of the model without increasing the depth. This combination can potentially lead to a better fit for data exhibiting both smooth and periodic characteristics, which may improve the log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel.

Analysis: This kernel combines the additive properties of the first parent, which may capture both smoothness and variance, with the multiplicative aspect of the SE kernel from the second parent. By using SE in a product form, this kernel can maintain the smoothness of the Gaussian process while potentially enhancing the overall fit to the data by leveraging the variance structure provided by RQ.

Analysis: This kernel expression retains the multiplicative interaction between the SE and PER kernels, which can capture smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data, while also including the RQ kernel. The inclusion of RQ, which can model varying length scales, helps to accommodate different scales of variability within the data. By ensuring that both the periodic and varying characteristics are covered, this combined kernel may lead to an improved fit and potentially higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: RQ (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: (SE + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel and adds periodicity through the PER kernel. By multiplying RQ with PER, it retains the ability to model varying lengths of scales while introducing periodic behavior, which can capture patterns in the data that may not be accounted for by the individual parent kernels. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parents to potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (RQ * PER))... LML=-4946.348

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * PER  
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels with addition and then multiplying by the Periodic (PER) kernel, we can capture both smoothness and periodicity in the data more effectively. This might lead to a better fit compared to the original kernel by allowing for greater flexibility in modeling variations, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying SE with PER, we can capture both smoothness and periodicity, and adding the product of SE and RQ allows us to introduce variability and adaptability to the model. This blend aims to enhance the fit to the data by leveraging the strengths of each kernel, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By combining the SE kernel with RQ and multiplying by the PER kernel, we introduce a more flexible structure that can potentially capture both smoothness (from SE) and varying length scales (from RQ) while maintaining periodicity (from PER). This combination may lead to a higher LML by better fitting the data through its diverse characteristics.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * (SE + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by preserving the additive combination of SE and RQ while introducing the periodic kernel (PER) to account for any potential periodic patterns in the data. By using a multiplicative structure with the additional periodic component, this expression may capture more complex relationships in the data, potentially leading to a higher LML than the parents. The depth is maintained at 3, keeping the expression simple yet effective.

Analysis: This kernel combines both parent kernels by taking the sum of the two base kernels (SE and RQ) and multiplying it by itself. This approach maintains the positive contributions of both kernels while potentially enhancing the flexibility and capacity to capture complex patterns in the data, which could lead to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The structure remains within the depth limit of 3, ensuring simplicity while maximizing the combination of their strengths.

Analysis: This kernel combines the effective properties of the squared exponential (SE) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels from Parent 1, while also incorporating the periodicity from Parent 2. The multiplication of SE with RQ captures the smoothness of SE while allowing for varying lengths scales through RQ. Adding the periodic component (PER * RQ) introduces the ability to model periodic patterns with some variability in amplitude and scale, potentially improving the fit to the observed data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which has already shown a specific LML score of -1.290. By keeping the multiplication with RQ, it leverages the flexibility of the RQ kernel while still combining it with the SE kernel to capture smoothness. The proposed kernel does not exceed the depth limit and is likely to maintain the expressiveness needed to achieve or exceed the LML score of the parents.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parents by taking the sum of the SE and RQ kernels, which allows for smoothness and flexibility, and then multiplying by the SE kernel to enhance the overall smoothness and continuity of the model.

    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * SE) + RQ
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by incorporating the interaction of the sum of SE and RQ with SE, while also adding RQ to introduce additional flexibility. This structure allows the model to capture both smooth variations from SE and the broader variability from RQ, potentially improving the fit to the data and achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel combines the base kernel SE with a modified version of Parent 2, where RQ is introduced to potentially capture additional variance in the data. By adding SE to the product of (SE + RQ) and RQ, we maintain a depth of 3 while leveraging both the smoothness of SE and the flexibility offered by RQ. This structure aims to enhance the fit by allowing for both local and global variations in the data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive relationship of the SE and RQ kernels, which captures smoothness and varying length scales, and multiplies it by the periodic kernel (PER). This combination allows for modeling both the smooth variations from SE and RQ while introducing periodicity through PER. This potentially enhances the kernel's flexibility in modeling complex patterns in the data, aiming for a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood than the parent kernels.
