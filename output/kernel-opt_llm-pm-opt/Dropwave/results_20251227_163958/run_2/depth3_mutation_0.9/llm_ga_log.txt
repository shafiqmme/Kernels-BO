Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE * (SE * RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: (RQ + (SE + PER)) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the interaction between the squared exponential (SE) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels through multiplication, allowing for effective modeling of smoothness at different scales. The addition of the periodic kernel (PER) captures any potential cyclic behavior in the data. This structure maintains a depth of 3 and leverages the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a better fit to the observed data and higher LML.
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + PER)... LML=-2.612
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By adding the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel to the product of the Periodic (PER) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, we can introduce more flexibility in the model. The PER * RQ combination captures varying periodic behavior with a different smoothness level, which might enhance the fit to the observed data. This modification should potentially result in a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) by allowing the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: This kernel takes advantage of the multiplicative interaction between the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, which can help capture both smoothness and varying length scales, while also incorporating the periodicity of the Periodic (PER) kernel through addition. This combination aims to balance the strengths of responsiveness to local variations from SE and RQ, while still maintaining periodic behavior from PER, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than the parent kernels.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:

Analysis: By changing the structure to add the SE kernel to the product of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels, we allow for the flexibility and smoothness of the SE kernel to dominate while still capturing the combined periodic and varying behavior of the PER and RQ kernels. This combination can potentially provide a better fit to the observed data, possibly increasing the LML.

Analysis: This kernel expression combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ kernels, which captures both smoothness and varying length scales, with the additive periodic kernel PER. By retaining the structure of Parent 1, we aim to leverage the strengths of the SE and RQ interaction while also incorporating periodicity from PER. This combination is likely to enhance the model's flexibility to fit the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than the parents.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of SE and RQ from Parent 1 with the periodicity of PER, while also incorporating a multiplicative interaction with RQ. This approach leverages the strengths of both parents by enhancing the flexibility to capture both smooth variations (via SE and RQ) and periodic patterns (via PER), potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML. The depth remains within the constraint of 3.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ  
Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the squared exponential kernel with the periodic kernel, which can capture smooth variations along with periodic trends, while also incorporating the rational quadratic kernel to account for varying smoothness. This combination aims to leverage the individual strengths of both parent kernels without exceeding the depth limit, potentially enhancing the fit to the observed data and improving the LML.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel modification introduces a combination of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels multiplied together, which can better capture complex patterns in the data. The addition of the squared exponential kernel allows for smooth variations while the product of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels captures both periodic behavior and varying scales. This combination may lead to a higher LML by providing more flexibility in modeling the data's underlying structure.

  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + PER) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (RQ * SE) + PER
Analysis: This kernel combines the rational quadratic (RQ) and squared exponential (SE) kernels multiplicatively, leveraging the smoothness properties of both kernels, which can help in capturing variations in the data more effectively. The addition of the periodic (PER) kernel allows for modeling periodic behavior, potentially addressing features in the data that the parents might have missed. This combination could lead to a better fit and higher LML by balancing local and global behaviors in the dataset.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of the periodic kernel and the rational quadratic kernel to an addition with the squared exponential kernel, we introduce more flexibility in the model. The additive combination allows for better fitting of the data by capturing both smooth variations (from SE) and interactions between periodic and rational characteristics (from PER and RQ). This modification may improve the LML by balancing the contributions of the kernels more effectively.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression retains the structure of Parent 2, which already shows a decent LML score of -1.290. By combining the periodic kernel (PER) with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) and multiplying this sum with the squared exponential kernel (SE), we can capture both the smoothness of SE and the variations introduced by the periodic and rational quadratic components. This combination leverages the strengths of both parents while adhering to the depth constraint, potentially improving the model's fit on the observed data.

Analysis: By changing the multiplication of SE with the sum of PER and RQ to an addition of SE with the product of PER and RQ, we can capture both the smoothness of SE and the combined periodic and rational characteristics of PER and RQ. This may provide a better fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML by allowing more flexibility in the representation of the underlying function.

  Parent 2: (SE * (SE * RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding the product of SE and RQ to the (SE * PER) term, it aims to capture both periodic fluctuations and varying smoothness in the data, potentially improving the fit and LML compared to the parent kernels. The structure remains within the allowed depth and maintains a balance between complexity and interpretability.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This modification introduces addition between the squared exponential kernel (SE) and the product of the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels. By combining these kernels in this way, we allow for a more flexible representation that can capture both smooth variations (from SE) and periodic patterns (from PER) while still accommodating varying length scales (from RQ). This structure may improve the fit to the data and potentially yield a higher LML compared to the original kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By taking the product of SE with both PER and RQ, we leverage the strengths of all three kernels without exceeding the depth constraint. This new combination may offer a better fit to the data by allowing for both periodic and varying smoothness patterns.

Analysis: By replacing the multiplication of the periodic kernel (PER) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) with an addition, we allow for greater flexibility in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. This adjustment could improve the fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) by leveraging the smoothness of the squared exponential kernel while still incorporating the periodic and varied characteristics of the other kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) with the sum of the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels. By focusing on SE as a base kernel, which is commonly effective for smooth functions, and allowing for the variation introduced by both periodic and rational quadratic components, this expression aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels. The depth is kept at 3, adhering to the constraint while potentially improving the LML by capturing both smoothness and periodic behavior.

Analysis: By replacing multiplication with addition as the primary operation, we allow for more flexibility in fitting the data. The term (PER * RQ) captures interactions between periodic and rational quadratic behaviors, while adding the squared exponential (SE) helps to maintain smoothness. This simpler structure may lead to a better fit and potentially a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)  
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the SE and PER kernels multiplicatively while also adding a multiplicative interaction with RQ. By leveraging both periodicity and smoothness (from SE), this new kernel aims to capture variations in the data that may not be fully represented by either parent expression alone. The addition of the interaction terms helps to explore the combined effects of periodicity and rational quadratic behavior without exceeding the depth constraint.

Analysis: By replacing the multiplication of SE with the sum of SE and the product of PER and RQ, we allow for more flexibility in fitting the data. The sum captures the variation explained by the SE kernel while preserving the periodic and rational characteristics through the interaction of PER and RQ. This may enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative strength of the SE and PER from Parent 2 with the additive aspect of RQ from Parent 1. By allowing the SE to influence both the periodic behavior (PER) and the combination of PER and RQ, this kernel aims to capture more complex patterns in the data while maintaining a manageable depth of 3. The hope is that this combination will provide a better fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML compared to the parent kernels.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE (Squared Exponential) and PER (Periodic) kernels with the RQ (Rational Quadratic) kernel. The depth remains 2, ensuring simplicity while leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels. The SE * PER term captures smoothness and periodicity, while adding the RQ kernel provides flexibility in modeling varying length scales. This combination may improve the fit to the data and potentially yield a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + RQ... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER  
Analysis: By replacing one instance of RQ in the original expression with SE and adjusting the structure, I aim to leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel combined with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. The addition of the PER kernel helps to capture periodic patterns while keeping the overall complexity manageable. This combination is expected to yield a better fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + PER... LML=-2.612
  Kernel depth: 3

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: RQ (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the SE * PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding RQ to the combination, we introduce additional capacity to model long-range correlations and varying signal variance, which may enhance the overall fit to the data and increase the log marginal likelihood. The depth of this expression is 2, ensuring it adheres to the specified constraints.
  Result: (SE * PER) + RQ... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER) * RQ
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) and the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel through addition, which may capture both local and global trends in the data more effectively. By multiplying this combination with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, which can model varying length scales, we enhance the flexibility of the model while staying within the depth limit. This combination could potentially yield a higher log marginal likelihood by better fitting the underlying structure of the observed data.
  Result: (SE + PER) * RQ... LML=-4946.353

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the SE kernel, similar to Parent 1's structure, while also incorporating the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel in a way that leverages the SE kernel's adaptability. By emphasizing the SE kernel's influence while maintaining a periodic component, this expression aims to capture both smoothness and periodic patterns, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * PER  
Analysis: By replacing the multiplication between SE and PER with an addition and then multiplying by PER, we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel combined with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This combination allows the kernel to capture both the local variations (from SE and RQ) and the periodic behavior (from PER) more effectively, potentially leading to a higher LML score.
  Result: (SE + RQ) * PER... LML=-4946.342
  Kernel depth: 3
