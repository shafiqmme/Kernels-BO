Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE * (SE * RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: (RQ + (SE + PER)) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interactions of the SE and RQ from Parent 1 with the additive influence of SE and PER. The combination aims to leverage the smoothness and locality of the SE kernel, the variability from the RQ kernel, and the periodicity from the PER kernel. This should provide a more flexible model that captures diverse patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than both parent kernels.

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the individual components of both parent kernels while introducing an additional multiplicative interaction term between the periodic and rational quadratic kernels (PER * RQ). This interaction term can capture complex patterns that neither parent kernel alone can represent, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood. The structure retains the basic forms of both parents, ensuring that the strengths of the squared exponential and periodic components are preserved while allowing for more flexibility through the added interaction.

  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: The original kernel combines periodic and rational quadratic components, which may introduce unnecessary complexity and could hinder fitting to the data. By simplifying the kernel to just the product of the squared exponential and rational quadratic (SE * RQ), we capture smoothness (from SE) while allowing for varying length scales (from RQ). This combination often leads to a better fit, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE * (SE * RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (RQ + (SE + PER)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ kernels, which can capture smooth variations in the data, while also incorporating the additive structure of the RQ kernel with the SE and PER components. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both parents by promoting flexibility in modeling while maintaining smoothness, potentially leading to a higher LML by effectively capturing both stationary and non-stationary patterns in the data.

  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By using addition between the SE kernel and the product of the PER and RQ kernels, we introduce interaction effects of periodic and rational behaviors without diminishing the smoothness provided by the SE kernel. This combination can capture both periodic patterns and varying lengths of correlation, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the existing kernel structure.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the rational quadratic scaling effect from Parent 1 with the periodicity captured by the PER kernel from Parent 2. By adding the two components, we allow for both smooth variations (from SE * RQ) and periodic behavior (from SE * PER) to be captured in the model. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of the periodic kernel (PER) and rational quadratic kernel (RQ) to an addition with the squared exponential (SE) kernel, we allow for smooth variations from the SE kernel while also capturing periodic patterns influenced by the product of PER and RQ. This combination can potentially model more complex relationships in the data, which may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative structure of Parent 1 with an additional additive component from Parent 2. By keeping the interaction between the SE kernel and the periodic and rational quadratic components, we enhance the flexibility of the model to capture both smooth variations and periodic fluctuations. This hybrid approach may improve the model's ability to fit complex data patterns, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * RQ)... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of the periodic kernel and the rational quadratic kernel to a multiplication of the periodic kernel with the squared exponential and then adding the rational quadratic kernel, we allow for a more flexible combination of periodic behavior and varying length scales. This adjustment may better capture the underlying patterns in the data, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + (RQ + (SE + PER))) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the existing structures of Parent 1 and Parent 2 by including the Rational Quadratic kernel directly in addition to the products of the other kernels. The component (SE * RQ) captures smoothness with varying length scales, while (SE * PER) incorporates periodicity. Adding RQ allows for a richer modeling of variance across the data, potentially enhancing the flexibility of the kernel and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ)... LML=-1.290

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: By combining the SE and RQ kernels through addition, we can capture both smoothness and varying length scales in the data. Multiplying this combination by the PER kernel allows for the incorporation of periodic patterns in the data. This modification is expected to improve the LML by better fitting the underlying structure of the observed data, especially if periodic behavior is present.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ * PER))
Analysis: This new kernel combines the existing components from both parents while introducing an interaction term that captures the multiplicative relationship between the periodic and rational quadratic elements. By adding the term (SE * RQ * PER), we allow for richer modeling capabilities that can capture variations that are influenced by both periodic behavior and varying length scales, potentially leading to improved fit and higher LML.
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ * PER))... LML=-4946.349

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: By combining the SE and PER kernels additively before multiplying with the RQ kernel, we allow for both smoothness (from SE) and periodicity (from PER) to influence the overall behavior of the kernel. This approach can help capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher LML by better modeling the underlying function. The multiplication with RQ assists in managing the varying lengths of correlation, which may further enhance the fit.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + ((SE * PER) * RQ))
Analysis: This new kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ kernels from Parent 1 while also incorporating the periodic behavior of the SE and PER kernels, enhanced by RQ, from Parent 2. By multiplying (SE * PER) with RQ, we aim to capture complex interactions that may lead to improved flexibility and adaptability to the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By simplifying the kernel expression and removing the additive component of (SE * PER) and the standalone RQ, we focus on the interaction between the SE and RQ kernels while still allowing for the periodic behavior of the PER kernel. This combination could capture both smooth variations (via SE * RQ) and periodic patterns (via PER), potentially improving the fit to the data and thus achieving a higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the existing structures of Parent 1 and Parent 2 while adding a multiplicative interaction term between the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels. This additional term allows the model to capture more complex patterns in the data that might arise from interactions between the periodic and rational quadratic behaviors, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)... LML=-4946.349

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: By removing the SE * PER term and replacing it with a product of the periodic kernel (PER) and rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we create a kernel that captures both periodic behavior and varying smoothness, which may better fit the data. The combination of SE with RQ maintains flexibility, while the addition of PER introduces periodicity without the potential redundancy of overlapping SE terms. This modification can enhance the overall expressiveness of the kernel, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 1 with the multiplicative interaction of both periodic and rational quadratic components from Parent 2. By introducing the term (PER * RQ), it allows for capturing more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML than either parent alone. The combined effects of periodicity and rational quadratic characteristics can provide a richer representation of the underlying function.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with both the RQ and PER kernels. The term (SE * RQ) captures varying smoothness and scale due to the rational quadratic component, while (SE * PER) introduces periodicity to the smooth variations. By combining these two interactions additively, we aim to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels by allowing the model to adapt to both smooth and periodic structures, potentially improving the fit and thereby increasing the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + (SE * RQ) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interactions of the base kernels from both parents while also introducing a new multiplicative interaction between RQ and PER. The inclusion of the (RQ * PER) term may capture additional variability in the data, leveraging the strength of periodic behavior alongside the rational quadratic behavior. This combination aims to enhance the flexibility of the model and potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood by better fitting the observed data.

Analysis: By removing the RQ term from the original kernel expression, we simplify the model, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the log marginal likelihood. The interaction between the SE and PER kernels captures both smoothness and periodicity effectively, while eliminating the additional RQ term may lead to a better overall fit on the observed data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + ((SE * RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using (SE * PER), we ensure that we capture the periodic structure in a smooth manner. Additionally, incorporating ((SE * RQ) * PER) allows for capturing variations that are both periodic and smooth, leveraging the strengths of all constituent kernels. This combination aims to balance the benefits of periodicity and smoothness, potentially improving the fit and thus achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By removing the standalone RQ term, we simplify the kernel while retaining the interactions between SE and the other kernels. This reduction may help to avoid overfitting and allow the model to focus more on the joint interactions between SE, RQ, and PER, potentially leading to a higher LML due to a more parsimonious model.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)) * RQ
Analysis: By multiplying the combined kernel of parent 1 with the RQ kernel, we introduce additional variability and flexibility that can help capture more complex patterns in the data. The multiplication with RQ enhances the model's ability to fit non-stationary data while still leveraging the smoothness from the SE and periodicity from the PER component. This combination aims to improve the log marginal likelihood by enhancing the kernel's expressiveness.

    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: By combining both parent kernels, I have taken the common structure of (SE * (PER + RQ)) and added it again. This redundancy can help capture additional variations in the data by reinforcing the contribution of the periodic and rational quadratic components, while still maintaining the influence of the squared exponential kernel. The goal is to improve the LML by leveraging the strengths of the periodic and rational quadratic interactions more robustly.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interactions of the SE and RQ from Parent 1 with the SE and PER interaction from Parent 2, while also introducing the additive effect of RQ and PER. The rationale is to leverage the strengths of both kernels by maintaining the effective variance captured by the rational quadratic component while incorporating periodic behavior, which may enhance the model’s flexibility in capturing complex patterns in the data. This combination aims to improve the log marginal likelihood by providing a richer representation of the underlying function.

Analysis: This new kernel expression takes the existing combination of the first parent and enhances the contribution of the periodic kernel by multiplying it with the rational quadratic kernel. This allows the model to capture both smooth variations from the SE and RQ, as well as periodic patterns without losing the flexibility of the RQ. By combining these strengths, we may achieve a better fit to the data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

Additionally, adding the PER kernel allows for capturing periodic variations that may not be fully represented in the other combinations. This blend is intended to leverage the strengths of the smoothness from RQ, the radial properties of SE, and the periodicity from PER, potentially leading to an improved fit and higher LML.

This interaction aims to exploit the periodic nature of the PER kernel alongside the variations captured by the RQ kernel, which could enhance the overall flexibility and expressiveness of the kernel. By maintaining the contributions from the SE kernel and adding the interaction term, this kernel might capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + (SE * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the first parent’s structure that captures the interaction between the squared exponential and the combined periodic and rational quadratic components, while also integrating a new multiplicative term (SE * (PER * RQ)). This additional term allows the kernel to model more complex interactions by leveraging the strengths of both periodicity and the rational quadratic behavior on top of the smoothness provided by the SE kernel, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood by better fitting the observed data.

  LLM Response:

Analysis: By combining the squared exponential (SE) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels additively first, we capture both smoothness and scaling properties of the data. Multiplying this sum by the periodic (PER) kernel allows us to model non-stationarities and periodic behaviors effectively. This modification aims to leverage the strengths of each component while potentially simplifying interactions, which can lead to better fit and increased log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interactions from Parent 1 while simplifying it by omitting the standalone RQ term, which may not add significant value given the performance of the others. By retaining the interaction of SE with both RQ and PER, this expression seeks to capture both the smoothness of the RQ and the periodicity of the PER, potentially leading to a better fit and improved LML.

Analysis: By simplifying the current kernel expression to focus on the interaction between the SE and RQ kernels while adding the PER kernel separately, we can potentially reduce complexity and improve the LML. The multiplication of SE and RQ captures non-stationary behavior, while adding the PER kernel can account for any periodic structures in the data without the extra complexity of multiple multiplications. This could lead to a better fit and higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with both RQ and PER (similar to Parent 2) while also including an additive term of PER. By incorporating both the multiplicative and additive aspects of the kernels, it allows for flexibility in capturing variations in the data. This combination can potentially enhance the model's ability to fit the observed data by leveraging the strengths of both periodic and rational quadratic behaviors. Additionally, the inclusion of the standalone PER term ensures that periodic patterns are explicitly represented in the kernel, potentially improving the overall fit and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ from Parent 1, which captures smoothness with varying length scales, alongside the periodic component from Parent 1. Additionally, it introduces the interaction between RQ and PER, which allows the model to account for both the varying smoothness and periodicity present in the data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of Parent 1, which effectively captures interactions between the periodic and rational quadratic behaviors modulated by the squared exponential, with the simpler addition of RQ from Parent 2. By retaining the interaction from Parent 1 while simplifying the overall structure, this kernel aims to maintain flexibility while potentially improving the LML by reducing unnecessary complexity. The rationale is that the presence of RQ alone may allow for a better fit in areas where the data does not exhibit periodic behavior, while still leveraging the interaction of SE with both PER and RQ in the other term.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using the product (SE * PER), we capture the interaction of the smoothness with periodic behavior, and by adding (SE * RQ), we leverage the ability of the RQ kernel to adapt to varying scales of variation in the data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interactions of the SE and RQ kernels (which can capture smoothness and varying length scales) with the additive interactions of SE and PER (which captures periodic features). By also including the interaction term (RQ * PER), we aim to capture both the periodic nature of the data and the varying length scales, potentially improving the model's flexibility and fit to the observed data, thereby increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER))... LML=-4946.349
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: By combining the SE and RQ kernels before multiplying with the periodic kernel, we allow for capturing both smoothness (from SE) and varying scales (from RQ) while still modeling periodic behavior effectively with PER. This modification may enhance the flexibility of the kernel structure, potentially leading to a better fit of the model to the observed data and thus a higher LML.

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: (SE + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by including the RQ and PER interactions with SE, while also adding the standalone SE term. The addition of the SE term allows for smoother variations in the data, potentially capturing additional underlying trends not accounted for by the other terms alone. This combination aims to leverage the flexibility of the SE kernel while maintaining the effects of periodicity and rational variation, optimizing the fit to the data and potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (SE * PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the additive part of Parent 1, which includes the SE kernel and the interaction between SE and PER, with the multiplicative influence of RQ. By multiplying the interaction term (SE * PER) with RQ, we allow for a richer representation of the data's variance and periodicity, potentially capturing more complex patterns than either parent kernel alone. This structure may enhance the model's flexibility and improve the fit to the observed data, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (SE * PER) * RQ)... LML=-4946.346

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + RQ)
Analysis: The proposed kernel simplifies the original by removing the redundancy of having two separate SE terms and combines the SE and PER directly. This reduction may improve the model's ability to capture the underlying structure of the data by focusing on the interaction between the SE and PER components, while still retaining the flexibility provided by the RQ kernel. This change can help in maximizing the log marginal likelihood by reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines terms from both parent kernels while introducing a new interaction term (PER * RQ). The interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components may capture more complex patterns in the data that neither of the parent kernels could fully exploit individually. By leveraging the strengths of the SE, RQ, and PER kernels together, this formulation aims to provide a better fit to the underlying structure of the observed data, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) + RQ (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ kernels from Parent 1 with the periodicity of the PER kernel from Parent 2, while maintaining the contribution from the RQ kernel. By allowing the PER kernel to interact with RQ, it can capture periodic variations effectively, while the SE kernel ensures smoothness and continuity in the function. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to improved flexibility and a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)... LML=-4946.355

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: By removing the last term RQ, we streamline the kernel. The combined terms (SE * RQ) and (SE * PER) already provide a balance of smoothness and periodicity. Removing RQ may help avoid overfitting and improve the LML by focusing on the interactions between SE and the other kernels. This reduction simplifies the model while still capturing essential characteristics of the data, potentially leading to better generalization.
