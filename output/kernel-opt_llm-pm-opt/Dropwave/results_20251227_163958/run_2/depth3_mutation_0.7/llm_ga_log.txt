  Parent 2: (RQ + (SE + PER)) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by taking the product of the SE and RQ kernels, which can capture smooth variations in the data while also allowing for longer-range correlations. Adding the PER kernel introduces periodicity, which can help model any cyclical patterns in the data. This combination aims to leverage the advantages of both parents while staying within the depth constraint of 3, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression directly combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, while retaining the foundational smoothness of the SE kernel. By ensuring that we maintain the structure from Parent 2, we avoid excessive complexity and leverage the potential strengths of periodicity and rational quadratic characteristics together, which could lead to improved fitting on the observed data without exceeding the depth limit.
  Result: (SE * (PER + RQ))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By replacing multiplication of SE with the sum of PER and RQ, we allow for a combination that can incorporate periodicity and rational quadratic characteristics in a more flexible way. This may capture variations in the data more effectively, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (RQ + (SE + PER)) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels. The SE kernel is known for its smoothness and ability to capture local variations, while the RQ kernel can model varying smoothness, making it suitable for data with multiple scales. By adding these two kernels together, we aim to leverage their complementary properties, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) than either parent kernel alone. This simple combination maintains a depth of 2, adhering to the constraints while possibly improving the fit to the data.
  Result: (SE + RQ)... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 2

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By adding the SE kernel to the product of PER and RQ, we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while still capturing periodicity and varying scales from the combination of PER and RQ. This modification can improve the fit by allowing for both local and global variations in the data, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already combines the SE and RQ kernels multiplicatively, allowing for flexibility in capturing smoothness and varying scales, while also adding the periodicity of the PER kernel on top. Given that Parent 1 has a lower LML than Parent 2, it may be beneficial to explore modifications of Parent 1’s structure while keeping its core combination intact. The aim is to maintain the strengths of both parents while ensuring the expression remains within the depth limit.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + PER... LML=-2.612
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the structure to a sum of the SE kernel and the product of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels, we allow for more flexibility in capturing both smooth trends (via SE) and variations (via the interaction of PER and RQ). This combination can potentially model more complex behaviors in the data, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE * (SE * RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines elements of both parent kernels by multiplying the SE kernel with both the PER and RQ kernels separately and then adding the results together. This approach leverages the smoothness of the SE kernel while incorporating the periodicity of the PER and the varying length scales of the RQ, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data and improving the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication to addition, we allow for more flexibility in the model. The combination of SE with the product of PER and RQ captures both smoothness (from SE) and periodic variations (from PER) while still accommodating broader variations (from RQ). This may provide a better fit to the data and potentially increase the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by using multiplication, which allows for the interaction between the smoothness of the SE kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This combination can capture both local and long-range dependencies in the data. By avoiding unnecessary complexity, this kernel maintains a depth of 2, making it simpler and potentially improving the LML by effectively leveraging the properties of both kernels.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This modification combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the interaction between PER and RQ. The addition of the SE kernel can help improve the overall fit to the data by introducing more flexibility, while the product of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels captures both periodicity and varying smoothness. This combination may lead to a higher LML by leveraging the strengths of each kernel more effectively than the current expression.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the SE kernel with both RQ and PER, leveraging the additive property of the kernels. By adding the SE term multiplied by the PER kernel to the existing SE * RQ kernel, we introduce periodic behavior while maintaining the rational quadratic nature, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data and improving the LML.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This modified kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) with the product of the Periodic (PER) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels. The addition of SE allows for smooth variations in the data while the multiplication of PER and RQ captures periodic patterns with varying length scales. This combination may enhance the model's flexibility, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of SE with PER from Parent 2 while also incorporating the additive interaction of SE with the combination of PER and RQ from Parent 1. This structure allows for flexibility in capturing both periodic and rational variations while maintaining a smoothness from the SE kernel, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) by leveraging the strengths of both parents. The depth is within the limit, ensuring simplicity and ease of computation.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the strengths of both parents by multiplying the squared exponential (SE) kernel with the sum of the rational quadratic (RQ) and periodic (PER) kernels. This approach captures the smoothness properties of SE while allowing for both periodic and varying length-scale behaviors through RQ and PER. By merging the two parents in this manner, it aims to leverage the advantages of each component, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: SE (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: The addition of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel to the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel can capture both smooth variations and varying lengths scales in the data. This combination tends to improve flexibility in modeling complex datasets, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to using SE alone.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the two parent kernels by leveraging both the multiplicative contributions of SE with PER, and the interaction of RQ with SE. By directly summing these interactions, we aim to capture the variance and periodicity from both parents, potentially leading to a better fit to the data and a higher LML score. This structure remains within the depth constraint while maximizing the strengths of both parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ  
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By keeping the SE * PER term, we retain the smoothness and periodicity, while adding RQ allows for better fit in areas where the data may exhibit varying length scales or noise. The proposed combination aims to leverage both periodic structure and the adaptability of the rational quadratic kernel, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel expression combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with both the RQ and PER kernels from Parent 2, while additionally incorporating the additive interaction with SE and PER from Parent 1. By leveraging both the periodicity of PER and the flexibility of RQ, this kernel aims to capture a broader range of patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by utilizing the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) base kernels together with a new term that introduces the Periodic (PER) kernel multiplied by RQ. This allows for capturing both smooth variations (from SE and RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER) in the data, potentially improving the fit and increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML) beyond the scores of the parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of Parent 1 (which captures a combination of smoothness from SE, variability from RQ, and periodicity from PER) with the simplicity of Parent 2 (SE). By adding the basic SE kernel to the complex interaction of (SE * RQ), we can potentially enhance the model's flexibility while retaining the smoothness characteristic of the SE kernel, which may lead to a better fit and improved LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines elements from both parent kernels by keeping the interaction between the SE and PER while introducing a direct product with RQ. This allows the model to capture both periodic behavior (from PER) and the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also considering the flexibility provided by the RQ kernel. The addition of RQ aims to enhance the fit to the data by leveraging the strengths of all three kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of both parent kernels. It retains the multiplicative relationship of SE with RQ from Parent 2 while also incorporating the periodicity from PER within the additive structure of Parent 1. By using (RQ + PER) within the SE multiplication, it allows for capturing both the rational quadratic behavior and the periodic variations, potentially enhancing the flexibility and fit to the data, which may lead to a higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with the PER kernel and also includes a multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with the RQ kernel. This approach leverages the strengths of the periodic behavior from the PER kernel while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel for varying length scales. By keeping the structure relatively simple and avoiding deep nesting, it may provide a better fit to the data, potentially improving LML beyond the values of the parent kernels.
