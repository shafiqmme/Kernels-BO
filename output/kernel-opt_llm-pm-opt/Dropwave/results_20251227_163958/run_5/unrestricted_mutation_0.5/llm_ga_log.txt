  Parent 2: (PER + (SE * RQ)) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ * SE) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the rational quadratic and squared exponential kernels, which can model various smoothness levels and scales in the data, with the periodic kernel that captures any periodic behavior in the data. By adding the periodic component to the combination of (RQ * SE), we allow for flexibility in modeling both smooth and periodic patterns simultaneously, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((RQ * SE) + PER)... LML=-2.612
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((RQ * SE) * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with a product of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and SE kernels. The addition of the SE kernel aims to capture smooth variations in the data, while the RQ component allows for varying smoothness. This combination can potentially generalize better and improve the fit, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ * SE) + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the Rational Quadratic and Squared Exponential from Parent 1 with the periodicity introduced by the Periodic kernel from Parent 2. By adding the periodic component scaled by RQ, we maintain the ability to capture both the smoothness from the SE and the varying scales from RQ, while also incorporating periodicity.

Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the RQ and SE from Parent 1 with the periodic behavior introduced by the PER kernel. The addition of the PER component allows for modeling periodic patterns while retaining the flexibility of the RQ and SE combination. By leveraging both the smoothness of the RQ and SE and the periodicity of the PER, this kernel aims to capture a wider range of underlying patterns in the data, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (RQ * SE)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: By changing the structure of the kernel, we are allowing the combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) to capture local variations while adding the Periodic (PER) kernel to account for any periodic patterns in the data. This can potentially improve the model's flexibility and adaptability to the underlying data patterns, thus maximizing the log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ * SE) * (SE + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines elements from both parent kernels by leveraging the multiplicative interaction of the RQ and SE kernels, while adding the periodicity from the PER kernel. The term (SE + PER) captures both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodic nature of the PER kernel, potentially improving the fit to data that exhibits both smooth and periodic patterns. By maintaining the multiplication with RQ, this new kernel aims to enhance flexibility and adaptability, which could lead to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * SE)) * PER  
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of Parent 1's ability to model smooth variations through the SE and RQ components, while also incorporating the periodic nature from Parent 2 with the PER kernel. By multiplying the smooth kernel combination with the periodic kernel, we can capture both smooth trends and periodic fluctuations in the data, potentially improving the fit and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.
  Result: (SE + (RQ * SE)) * PER... LML=-4946.329
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (RQ * SE)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels additively, we can capture both smoothness and scale variations. Multiplying the resulting sum by the Periodic (PER) kernel allows us to model any periodic behavior in the data while still retaining flexibility from the other kernels. This combination is likely to provide a better fit to the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the current kernel.

  Parent 2: ((RQ * SE) * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ * SE) * (SE + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative strength of the RQ and SE from Parent 2 with the additive influence of the SE and PER from Parent 1. By using (SE + PER) as a modulation factor, we can capture both smooth and periodic behaviors effectively while enriching the overall flexibility of the model. This approach is likely to enhance the fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML beyond that of either parent kernel.

  Parent 2: ((RQ * SE) + PER) (LML: -2.612)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smooth characteristics of the SE and RQ kernels. By using multiplication with PER, we aim to capture periodic variations while maintaining smoothness from the other kernels. This combination can potentially model complex behaviors in the data better than the individual parent kernels, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By replacing one instance of SE with PER, we introduce periodicity into the model, which can capture variations in the data that are cyclic in nature. This modification can potentially enhance the fit to the data, especially if there are underlying periodic patterns, and thus may lead to a higher LML.

    Kernel: ((RQ * SE) + PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the rational quadratic and squared exponential kernels from Parent 1, which captures both smoothness and varying length scales, with the periodic kernel from Parent 2, which can model any periodic behavior in the data. By using addition, the resulting kernel retains the flexibility to model complex relationships while potentially improving the log marginal likelihood by integrating the periodicity aspect present in Parent 2. This combination leverages the strengths of both parent kernels, aiming for a better fit to the observed data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ * SE) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of the first parent, which leverages the RQ and SE multiplication to capture smooth variations, with the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By adding the PER kernel to the RQ * SE product, we allow the model to incorporate both smooth and periodic behaviors. This new expression aims to retain the flexibility of the parent kernels while potentially improving the fit to the data, possibly resulting in a higher LML score.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * SE) + ((RQ * SE) * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by incorporating elements of both. The term (SE + (RQ * SE)) captures the smoothness of the SE kernel while allowing for variability introduced by the RQ kernel. By adding the additional term ((RQ * SE) * RQ), we enhance the model's flexibility to capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) by leveraging both the long-range dependencies and the varying length scales provided by the RQ component.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 1, which leverages the RQ scaling with SE, along with the periodicity introduced by PER from Parent 2. By including both the SE and RQ combination and the PER modulated by RQ, we aim to capture both smooth variations and periodic trends in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: By introducing the PER (Periodic) kernel into the combination, we allow the model to capture periodic patterns in the data while still leveraging the smoothness of the SE (Squared Exponential) kernel. The multiplication with RQ (Rational Quadratic) adds flexibility to the model by accommodating varying lengths scales, which might help improve the fit to the observed data. This combination could potentially result in a higher log marginal likelihood by enhancing the model's capacity to adapt to the underlying structure of the data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by adding the SE and RQ kernels together, which allows for a flexible representation of the data's smoothness and varying length scales. The resulting sum is then multiplied by the periodic kernel (PER), which captures any periodic patterns in the data. This combination could enhance the model's ability to fit complex structures in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * SE) + (PER * SE))
Analysis: By combining the existing components of Parent 1, which already incorporates the RQ kernel's ability to model varying smoothness, with the addition of a periodic component (PER), we can capture any potential periodic patterns in the data. The inclusion of PER alongside the existing SE and RQ components enhances the kernel's flexibility, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML than either parent alone. This new combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parents while introducing new variability through periodicity.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the squared exponential (SE) with the periodicity of the PER kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the rational quadratic (RQ) kernel. By multiplying the summed effects of (SE + PER) with RQ, we allow the model to capture both smooth variations and periodic structures in the data, while also being able to handle varying lengths scales. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by incorporating the smoothness of the SE kernel, the periodic nature of the PER kernel, and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. The addition of PER allows capturing periodic trends while maintaining the smoothness from SE. The term (RQ * SE) introduces additional flexibility by allowing the model to adapt its variability based on the data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, while also incorporating the smoothness of the SE kernel. By using addition between SE and PER, we allow for both smooth and periodic variations in the data, which can capture complex patterns. The multiplication with RQ further adds the ability to model varying lengths scales, potentially improving the fit to the observed data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood (LML).

    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (1 + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the existing structure of Parent 1 while also introducing an additional multiplicative component from the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel to enhance flexibility. By multiplying with (1 + RQ), we allow for an amplification effect that can capture more variance in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The combination aims to leverage the smoothness of the SE and the variability of the RQ to create a more expressive kernel.

The product allows for varying length scales, potentially improving the fit compared to the more complex structure of the current kernel, which may be introducing unnecessary complexity. This can lead to an increase in log marginal likelihood by providing a better balance between fit and complexity.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the first parent by retaining the SE and RQ components while introducing the periodic nature of the PER kernel. The SE kernel can model smooth variations, while RQ adds flexibility in capturing varying degrees of smoothness, and the PER kernel can account for periodic patterns in the data. By adding PER to the existing structure, we aim to enhance the model's ability to fit data that may exhibit periodic behavior, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of Parent 1 and Parent 2 by maintaining the additive structure of Parent 2 while introducing a multiplicative interaction with the RQ kernel. The addition of RQ aims to capture long-range correlations and varying smoothness, potentially improving the model's flexibility and ability to fit the observed data better, which might lead to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: This kernel combines elements from both parent kernels by taking the addition of the SE kernel along with the interaction of RQ and SE, while also retaining the more complex interaction term from Parent 1, which is ((RQ * SE) * RQ). By balancing the simpler structure of Parent 2 with the richer structure of Parent 1, this new kernel aims to capture a wider range of patterns in the data, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE + PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by incorporating the periodic component (PER) alongside the existing components from Parent 1. The addition of the periodic kernel allows the model to capture patterns that may exhibit periodic behavior, while still leveraging the contributions from the SE and RQ components. This combination increases the flexibility of the kernel, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood by fitting the data more accurately.

    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the existing elements from both parent kernels while introducing an additional interaction term between the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels. The rationale behind this is that the first parent already captures the smoothness and periodic characteristics through the SE and PER combination, while the second parent leverages the flexibility of RQ. By including the (RQ * PER) term, we aim to enrich the model with the potential to capture both long-range dependencies (from RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER), which could lead to a better fit on the observed data, thus maximizing the LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * SE) + (RQ * (SE + RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by integrating the base kernels SE and RQ through addition and multiplication. The term (SE + RQ) captures the flexibility of both the squared exponential and rational quadratic behaviors, while multiplying by SE allows for smoothness in the predictions. The additional component (RQ * (SE + RQ)) introduces periodic variations, enhancing the model's ability to fit complex patterns.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parents by leveraging the smoothness of the SE kernel, the periodicity of the PER kernel, and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. The addition of SE with PER captures periodic variations, while the multiplication with (RQ + SE) introduces additional flexibility and smoothness to the overall kernel structure. This combination is expected to enhance the fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood by addressing both periodic and non-periodic structures in the data.

Analysis: By simplifying the kernel and replacing the multiplication of RQ with SE, we can leverage the periodic nature of the PER kernel to capture potential oscillatory patterns in the data. This change may help in improving the model's ability to fit the observed data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood. The addition of RQ allows for capturing varying length scales, while PER ensures we account for periodic behavior, which might not have been fully utilized in the previous kernel expression.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE * RQ))
Analysis: This new kernel combines the periodicity and smoothness aspects of both parents by retaining the term (SE + (RQ * SE)) from Parent 1, which emphasizes the flexibility of the model, while integrating the multiplicative structure of (SE * RQ) from Parent 2. This combination aims to capture both local variations due to the RQ component and the global smoothness from the SE kernel, potentially improving the LML by leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels without unnecessary complexity.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the two parent kernels by applying addition to leverage both structures. The first part, ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE * RQ)), retains the interaction between the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels, while the second part, ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * RQ), focuses on the periodicity of the rational quadratic kernel. By combining them, we aim to capture both local and global variations more effectively, which may improve the log marginal likelihood by allowing for more complex relationships in the data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the existing strengths of both parent kernels by including the SE * RQ term from Parent 1, which captures smoothness and variability, and the SE * PER term from Parent 2, which introduces periodicity to the model. Additionally, by incorporating (RQ * PER), we provide flexibility to capture both long-range correlations and periodic behavior, potentially improving the LML by accommodating a wider range of data patterns. This combination aims to leverage the advantages of all the base kernels involved, thus increasing the likelihood of better fit to the observed data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 2, which captures the base behavior of the data through the squared exponential and the rational quadratic interaction, with the multiplicative aspect of RQ from Parent 1. The multiplication with RQ allows for capturing varying smoothness in the data while maintaining the flexibility of the additive component.

Analysis: This kernel expression combines elements from both parent kernels. By adding the term (RQ * PER), we introduce an interaction between the Rational Quadratic and Periodic kernels, which could capture additional variability in the data that the existing terms might miss. The combination of these three components aims to leverage the strengths of the parent kernels while potentially improving the log marginal likelihood by including more complex relationships in the data.

    Kernel: (((SE + (RQ * SE)) * RQ) + ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE * RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of Parent 1 and Parent 2 by utilizing the addition operator to merge their strengths. It retains the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ kernels while also incorporating the additive components from both parents. This hybrid approach aims to capture both the smoothness from the SE kernel and the variability from the RQ kernel, potentially leading to a better fit to the data and a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: (((SE + (RQ * SE)) * RQ) + ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE * RQ)))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 5

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By combining the squared exponential (SE) with the rational quadratic (RQ) through multiplication, we can capture smooth variations while accommodating for varying length scales. Adding the periodic kernel (PER) allows us to model seasonal or cyclic behaviors, which may improve the fit for data with periodic patterns. This modification aims to leverage the strengths of each kernel type, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) due to enhanced flexibility in capturing complex data structures.
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + PER)... LML=-2.612
  Kernel depth: 3

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE + (RQ * SE))) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE * RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE + (RQ * RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of Parent 1, which effectively captures local variations through the SE and RQ interaction, with Parent 2’s approach to enhancing the long-range behavior of the kernel using RQ. By replacing the second SE in Parent 2 with (RQ * RQ), we introduce additional flexibility to model complex relationships while still maintaining the core structure that helped both parent kernels achieve decent LML scores. This may allow for better fitting of the data, potentially increasing the LML.
  Result: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * (SE + (RQ * RQ)))... LML=-1.290

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + (RQ * SE)) * RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By separating the SE and RQ components and combining them with the PER kernel, we allow for both smooth variations (from SE * RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER) to be captured distinctly. This can provide a more flexible fit to the data, potentially leading to higher LML by accommodating both the smoothness of the data and any periodic behavior that may be present.
