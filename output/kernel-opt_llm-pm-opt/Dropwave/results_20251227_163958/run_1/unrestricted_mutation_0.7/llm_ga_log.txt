Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  Parent 2: (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the first parent kernel with the robustness of the rational quadratic from the second parent. By adding the two structures, we allow for both periodic fluctuations and varying length scales, potentially capturing a wider range of patterns in the data. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than either parent.
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + RQ)))... LML=-2.615
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + RQ))
Analysis: The original kernel uses the Rational Quadratic kernel in a way that may not capture the smoothness as effectively as the Squared Exponential kernel. By replacing the outer RQ with SE, we can leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel, which often leads to better fits for many datasets. This modification maintains the combination of the two RQ kernels, allowing for flexibility while potentially increasing the overall LML.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature from both parents while introducing the rational quadratic component to capture varying smoothness in the data. The addition of the RQ term to the periodic kernel allows for more flexible modeling of the underlying function, potentially leading to a better fit compared to the individual parent kernels. The aim is to leverage the periodicity while also incorporating the adaptability of the RQ kernel, which may help in improving the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * PER))... LML=-4946.350
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: By simplifying the kernel to just the product of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ), we may achieve a better balance between flexibility and smoothness. The original kernel had a redundancy in the RQ components, which could be limiting the model's ability to capture the underlying data structure. The combination of SE and RQ allows for both smoothness and the capability to model varying length scales, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) with the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel. By multiplying SE with the sum of RQ and PER, we aim to capture both the varying scales of the data (through RQ) and any periodic behavior (through PER), while maintaining overall smoothness. This combination is likely to enhance the fit to the data, potentially yielding a higher log marginal likelihood than either parent kernel.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of RQ and PER to a summation with SE, we allow for the flexibility of capturing both smooth variations (via SE) and periodic characteristics (via PER) while still incorporating the additional variations provided by RQ. This combination may provide a better fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher LML. The interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components might also help in capturing complex patterns in the data more effectively.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the advantages of both parent kernels by leveraging the squared exponential's ability to model smoothness (SE) with both the rational quadratic's flexibility for varying length scales (RQ) and the periodic nature of the periodic kernel (PER). By adding the two components, the new kernel can capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interactions of the squared exponential with the rational quadratic, while also incorporating the periodic component in a way that captures more complex patterns. By adding the two forms—one that emphasizes the rational quadratic's ability to model varying smoothness and the other that retains periodicity—we aim to improve flexibility in fitting the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than both parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + ((RQ * (RQ + PER)) * SE)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the structure of both parent kernels while aiming to leverage the strengths of the individual components. The first part, (SE * RQ), captures smoothness and variability, while the second part, ((RQ * (RQ + PER)) * SE), introduces additional flexibility and periodicity in the model. By multiplying RQ with both itself and PER, we can account for varying scales in length and periodic behavior, which may enhance the fit to the data and potentially improve the log marginal likelihood over the given parent kernels.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + ((RQ * (RQ + PER)) * SE)... LML=-4946.331
  Kernel depth: 5

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: By modifying the kernel to use addition of the SE and PER kernels before multiplying by the RQ kernel, we allow for a combination of smoothness and periodicity that may better capture the underlying data patterns. This change aims to enhance the model's flexibility, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood by accommodating both smooth variations and periodic structures in the data.

  Parent 2: (SE * RQ) + (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the rational quadratic's flexibility in modeling varying smoothness with the squared exponential's ability to capture general trends. By incorporating the periodic kernel (PER) as a separate additive component, it allows the model to capture periodic patterns without overwhelming the overall structure. This strategic combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parents while simplifying the interaction, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: By adding the RQ kernel to the SE kernel, we introduce flexibility in capturing variations in the data due to the rational quadratic nature, which can help model non-stationarity better. Multiplying by the PER kernel allows for periodic patterns in the data to be captured simultaneously with the smooth variations from the SE and RQ kernels. This combination is likely to improve the model's fit and therefore increase the LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * (RQ + PER)))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the structure of both parent kernels by leveraging the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with the RQ and the periodic component. By adding the direct contribution of the SE with RQ and the combined effect of SE with both RQ and PER, we aim to capture both the smoothness of the RQ and the periodicity in the data, which could potentially enhance the fit and yield a higher LML score.
  Result: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * (RQ + PER)))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of RQ and PER to a summation with SE, we allow for the combination of the smoothness from the SE kernel with the flexibility of the periodic and rational quadratic components. This could better capture variations in the data, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the core components of both parent kernels while introducing an interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic kernels (PER * RQ). The addition of this term allows for capturing periodic variations modulated by the scale and smoothness of the rational quadratic kernel, potentially leading to a better fit on the observed data and thus a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (PER * RQ)... LML=-4946.356
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: By combining the SE and PER kernels through addition before multiplying with the RQ kernel, we allow for both smoothness and periodicity to contribute to the model. This structure can capture more complex patterns in the data, which may lead to an improved fit and a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the original kernel formulation.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (RQ * (RQ + PER)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction between the SE and RQ kernels with the additive structure of RQ and PER from Parent 1. By incorporating SE, it captures smoothness and local variation, while the RQ kernel allows for varying length scales, and the addition of PER introduces periodic behavior. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially increasing the LML by accommodating more complex patterns in the data.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By adding the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel to the product of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels, we allow for a broader range of flexibility. The SE kernel captures smooth variations, while the product (RQ * PER) can model complex behaviors that include both the non-stationarity of RQ and the periodicity of PER. This combination is likely to improve the fit to the data and thus increase the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the first component of Parent 1, which captures the interaction between the SE and RQ kernels, with the periodicity introduced by PER from Parent 1. By incorporating PER into the mix while maintaining the SE and RQ interaction, we aim to enhance the model's flexibility in capturing both smooth variations (via SE and RQ) and periodic behavior (via PER). This may lead to improved fitting to data structures that exhibit both smooth and periodic trends, potentially resulting in a higher LML compared to the parent kernels.

Analysis: By combining the squared exponential kernel (SE) with the product of the rational quadratic (RQ) and periodic (PER) kernels, we can capture both smooth variations (from SE) and periodic patterns modulated by varying lengths (from the RQ * PER combination). This structure allows for both local and periodic features, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood by better fitting the observed data, especially if it contains periodic trends or varying smoothness.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the RQ kernel's ability to model varying smoothness with the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By multiplying RQ with PER, we introduce periodicity to the variability of the response, which can help capture any underlying periodic patterns in the data while still retaining the flexibility of the RQ kernel's varying length scale. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the advantages of both parent kernels, potentially leading to improved fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel while also incorporating the periodicity of the PER kernel. By using addition, it leverages the strengths of both the SE * RQ component for capturing variations and the PER component for periodic trends, aiming to achieve better fit and potentially a higher LML than the parent kernels.

The original kernel included multiplication with RQ, which can introduce additional noise or complexity that may not fit the data well. The combination of SE and PER can model smooth variations along with periodic patterns, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel for smoothness and the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel for capturing varying length scales. Adding the Periodic (PER) kernel allows the model to account for periodic patterns in the data, which might not have been fully captured in the original parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the existing structures of both parent kernels by merging their components. The term (SE * RQ) captures smoothness with varying length scales, while (SE * PER) introduces periodicity. The additional term (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) leverages the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic kernel, allowing for modeling non-stationary behavior and varying smoothness. This combination aims to harness the strengths of both parent kernels in modeling the data more effectively, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: This kernel combines the rational quadratic kernel's flexibility in modeling varying lengths scales with the periodic kernel, allowing for the capture of periodic patterns in the data. By maintaining the SE component, we ensure a smooth overall structure while providing additional complexity through the PER kernel. The combination is expected to improve the fit to the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood beyond the scores of the parent kernels.

The additive structure can help capture global trends (via SE) while still accounting for periodic behavior (via PER) and varying length scales (via RQ). This change may enhance the model's capacity to fit the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ from Parent 2 with the additive structure of RQ and PER from Parent 1. By allowing the SE to interact with both RQ and PER, this expression aims to capture both the smoothness and periodicity in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML than either parent kernel. The inclusion of both periodic and rational quadratic characteristics should enhance the flexibility of the kernel, accommodating a wider variety of patterns in the observed data.

The SE kernel captures smooth variations while the PER kernel accounts for periodic behavior. This combination may provide a better fit to the data without the additional complexity of the RQ kernel, which may not be necessary given the current model's performance.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the first part of Parent 2, which captures the interaction between the SE and RQ kernels, with a direct interaction between the SE and PER kernels. By including the SE * PER term, we leverage the periodic behavior while still maintaining the rational quadratic flexibility in the other part of the kernel.

Analysis: This kernel combines the two parent kernels by taking the sum of the product of the SE and RQ with the sum of the SE and PER, and then multiplying by the sum of RQ and PER. This design leverages the variability introduced by the periodic kernel while maintaining the smoothness from the SE and RQ. The multiplication with (RQ + PER) aims to enhance the expressiveness of the kernel in capturing periodic patterns and varying scales, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood beyond that of either parent.

Analysis: By changing the multiplication of RQ and PER to a sum with SE, we allow for a more flexible combination of the distance-based and periodic behaviors. The SE kernel captures the smoothness of the function, while combining RQ and PER through multiplication allows for capturing varying scale and periodicity effectively.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the SE kernel with both the RQ and PER kernels separately, allowing for flexibility in capturing varying smoothness and periodicity in the data. By including both components from the first parent while simplifying the second parent, this kernel aims to leverage the benefits of the SE's smoothness and the RQ's ability to model non-stationarity while still addressing the periodic nature captured by the PER kernel.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parents by integrating the rational quadratic behavior (RQ) with the smoothness of the squared exponential (SE) and the periodic nature of the PER kernel. The term (SE * RQ) captures variations with smoothness and long-range dependence, while (RQ * PER) introduces periodicity which can be beneficial for capturing cyclic patterns in the data.

The addition of the second parent, which is a rational quadratic kernel, allows for better handling of varying lengths of scale in the data. The combination of the squared exponential with both rational quadratic and periodic kernels provides flexibility in capturing smooth variations and periodic trends while still accommodating the long-range dependencies.

Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) to capture smoothness with the rational quadratic (RQ) and periodic (PER) components. The RQ kernel allows for varying smoothness, which is present in both parent kernels, while adding the periodic kernel introduces the ability to model periodic behavior in the data. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of the smoothness from SE, the varying length scales from RQ, and the periodic structure from PER, potentially resulting in a better fit and higher LML than either parent alone.

By incorporating the RQ kernel twice (as in Parent 1) while also ensuring the contribution of the periodic kernel from Parent 2, we aim to capture both long-range and localized variations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially improving the fit to the data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood.

By changing the operator to addition, we allow for a more flexible combination of the periodic and rational quadratic features, which could better capture the underlying structure of the data. The addition of SE ensures smoothness while accommodating variations introduced by the other kernels. This modification aims to improve the LML by enhancing the expressiveness of the kernel.

[LLM-GA] Iteration 47/50
================================================================================

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE * (RQ + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the sum of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels. By using the multiplication of SE, which provides smoothness and flexibility in fitting, with the addition of RQ and PER, we can capture both varying scales of smoothness (from RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER). This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to better fit the observed data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) score.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: By removing one of the RQ components from the original kernel, we simplify the expression. The addition of multiple RQ kernels can introduce redundancy and complexity that may not be necessary for capturing the underlying data structure. The new kernel retains the combination of the RQ and PER kernels while ensuring that the SE kernel maintains its influence, potentially leading to a better balance and higher LML.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-1.290

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ from Parent 2 with the addition of a periodic component (PER) through the interaction with RQ from Parent 1. By leveraging the strengths of the rational quadratic kernel in capturing varying smoothness and the squared exponential kernel's ability to model smooth functions, this new kernel aims to enhance flexibility and potentially capture more complex patterns in the data, which may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-1.290
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: By separating the components, we allow the squared exponential kernel (SE) to model smooth variations effectively while capturing the long-range dependencies with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ). Adding the periodic kernel (PER) can account for any periodic behavior in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and increased LML compared to the original expression. This structure helps in leveraging the strengths of each kernel component more distinctly.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + PER... LML=-2.612

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of both parent kernels by adding a new term that incorporates the periodicity of the PER kernel along with the rationality of the RQ kernel. The addition of the (SE * PER) term allows the model to capture both periodic behavior and smooth variations, potentially leading to a better fit. By leveraging both parent kernels and their interactions, this expression aims to improve the LML by capturing more complex relationships in the data.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) + (SE * PER)... LML=-4946.344
  Kernel depth: 5

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: By simplifying the kernel and removing the redundant RQ term from the sum, we maintain the flexibility of the RQ and PER while potentially reducing noise in the model. This can improve the LML by focusing on the most significant components of the covariance structure without unnecessary complexity.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-1.290

  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ + PER + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines elements from both parent kernels by retaining the multiplicative interaction of SE with RQ and PER from Parent 1, while also adding a second instance of SE * RQ from Parent 2. This approach aims to leverage the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel to model varying smoothness while also capturing periodic behavior, potentially enhancing the overall fit to the observed data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood.
