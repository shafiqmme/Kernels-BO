Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  Parent 2: (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the first parent with the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel from the second parent. By using (PER * PER), we maintain the periodic structure, while (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) introduces additional variability, effectively modeling more complex patterns in the data. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels to better fit the observed data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + RQ)))... LML=-2.615
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: The original kernel uses a combination of rational quadratic kernels, which may lead to overfitting due to redundancy. By replacing two RQ kernels with the squared exponential (SE) kernel, we introduce smoothness and flexibility in the model while maintaining a long-range correlation structure. The SE kernel is known for its ability to capture smooth functions effectively, which might improve the fit to the data and consequently increase the log marginal likelihood (LML).

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic structure from both parents (PER * PER) with an additional component that captures smoothness and flexibility from the squared exponential (SE) and the rational quadratic (RQ) kernel. The SE kernel can help model variations that are not periodic, while RQ can manage varying smoothness, potentially improving the overall fit to the data and achieving a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). This mixture aims to leverage the strengths of periodicity and smoother transitions in the data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the flexibility of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the capacity of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels to capture varying length scales and periodic behavior. By using SE, we can model smooth variations in the data more effectively, while RQ can help manage non-stationarity and PER can capture periodic patterns. This combination is likely to provide a richer representation of the underlying data structure, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) score compared to the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (RQ * ((PER * PER) + PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of the first parent, which utilizes the rational quadratic kernel for flexibility in modeling varying smoothness, with the second parent's periodic kernel structure. By multiplying the RQ kernel with the combination of the periodic kernel, we retain the ability to model periodic behavior while also introducing varying smoothness, potentially allowing for a better fit to the data. This combination could lead to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parents.

Analysis: This kernel combines the flexibility of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels. By using SE as a base and combining it with both RQ and PER, we capture both smoothness and periodicity while allowing for varying length scales (from RQ). This combination aims to enhance the fit to the data by leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER)) + (RQ * (RQ + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the smoothness and flexibility of the SE kernel with the adaptability of the RQ and the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By adding both parent kernels, we allow the model to capture a wider range of patterns in the data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) due to increased expressiveness. The combination aims to address both local variations (captured by the SE) and broader structure (captured by the RQ and PER), enhancing overall model fit.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:

Analysis: By switching the multiplication of RQ and PER, we allow for a more flexible interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data. The addition of SE provides a smooth baseline that can enhance fit, especially if the data exhibits both periodic and varying length scales. This combination could lead to a better representation of the underlying structure, possibly improving the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the components of both parent kernels. The term (SE * RQ) captures smoothness and varying length scales, which is beneficial for modeling non-stationary data. The term (PER * PER) allows for capturing periodic patterns in the data. By adding these two components together, the kernel can leverage the strengths of both smoothness and periodicity, potentially leading to improved flexibility and better fit, which may increase the log marginal likelihood (LML).

    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) * (PER + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the rational quadratic kernel, which captures varying smoothness, with the periodic kernel to account for periodicity in the data. By multiplying the sum of the periodic kernels with the product of the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels, we enhance the model's ability to fit both smooth and periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the squared exponential kernel (SE) with both the rational quadratic (RQ) and periodic (PER) kernels. By using an additive approach, it captures smooth variations from the SE kernel while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel for varying length scales and the periodicity from the PER kernel. This combination is likely to improve the fit to the observed data by accommodating both smooth and periodic patterns, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the benefits of both parent kernels. By adding the term (SE * PER) to the existing (SE * RQ), we incorporate the periodic behavior that can capture oscillations in the data while still maintaining the flexibility of the rational quadratic term. This combination may provide a richer representation of the underlying function, potentially leading to an improved fit and higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.

Analysis: By changing the multiplication of the rational quadratic and periodic kernels to an addition with the squared exponential kernel, we allow for better modeling of both long-range behavior (captured by SE) and local variations (captured by RQ * PER). This combination can help in capturing more nuanced patterns in the data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ * (RQ + RQ)) + ((PER * PER) * (SE * RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative structure of Parent 1 with the additive structure of Parent 2. By taking the RQ kernel's flexibility to capture varying smoothness from Parent 1 and incorporating the periodicity from Parent 2, we aim to achieve a more expressive kernel that can model complex patterns in the data. The addition of the scaled periodic kernel provides a means to capture seasonal or cyclical behaviors while still leveraging the strengths of the rational quadratic kernel's ability to fit data with varying degrees of smoothness. This should enhance the log marginal likelihood by allowing the model to adapt better to the underlying structure of the observed data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + ((SE * RQ) * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness properties of the SE and RQ kernels. By multiplying (SE * RQ) with PER, we introduce a modulation effect that allows for varying amplitudes in periodic patterns, while also maintaining the global smoothness of the SE kernel. This combination is expected to capture both the periodic nature of the data and any underlying trends, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels through addition. This combination can capture both smoothness (from SE) and varying length scales (from RQ) more effectively than the original kernel. By simplifying the structure and avoiding the periodic component, we focus on continuous variations, which may align better with the underlying data distribution, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: The current kernel combines the SE kernel with a product of RQ and PER, which may introduce complexity that is unnecessary for the observed data. By simplifying the kernel to a sum of SE and RQ, we can capture both smoothness (from SE) and flexibility (from RQ) without the potentially limiting periodicity from PER. This reduced complexity may lead to a better fit, thereby increasing the log marginal likelihood.

This approach aims to capture the effects of both periodic and rational quadratic variations in the data while leveraging the smoothness of the SE kernel. The additional SE * PER term can help refine the model by adjusting for periodic behavior, potentially improving the overall fit and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

The SE kernel captures the overall trend and smoothness of the data, while the RQ kernel provides additional flexibility to model varying degrees of smoothness. By multiplying RQ with itself (RQ + RQ), we increase its capacity to fit complex structures in the data.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative relationship of the SE and RQ from Parent 2, which captures smoothness and varying length scales, with a modified addition of SE and PER from Parent 1. By multiplying this sum by RQ, we leverage the periodic nature of PER while maintaining the smoothness characteristics of SE and RQ. This combination aims to enhance flexibility in modeling data that may exhibit both periodic behavior and varying smoothness, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (RQ * (RQ + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parents by incorporating the flexibility of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel to model smooth variations in the data with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, which can capture varying lengths scales. The term (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) retains the richness of the parent with the repeated RQ, potentially allowing for more complex patterns. By adding (SE * RQ), we aim to leverage both smoothness and varying scales, which could lead to a better fit and higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by maintaining the additive structure of the SE kernel while integrating the periodicity from the PER kernel into the RQ structure. The term (RQ + PER) allows for the flexibility of capturing both smooth and periodic variations in the data, which could improve the fit and potentially yield a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the element of the first parent, which leverages the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of RQ and the periodicity of PER, while also introducing an additional term that emphasizes the periodic component independently. This hybrid approach aims to retain the benefits of both smoothness and periodicity, potentially allowing for a better fit to the data and thereby increasing the LML.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodicity and smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying SE with RQ, we introduce a smooth component that can capture variations in the data while retaining the long-range dependence properties of RQ. Adding the term (RQ * (RQ + RQ)) incorporates the strengths of the parent kernels, allowing for both local and global patterns to be modeled effectively. This combination has the potential to improve the log marginal likelihood by balancing the characteristics of both kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness properties of the (SE + RQ) parent kernel, which captures both rapid variations and long-range dependencies, with the periodicity of the PER kernel. By multiplying the two, we allow the model to capture both the variations introduced by the RQ and SE while incorporating periodic behavior, which may lead to a better fit for data that exhibits both smooth and periodic patterns.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the additive structure from Parent 1 with the multiplicative interaction from Parent 2. The term (RQ * PER) captures the interaction between the rational quadratic and periodic components, which may help in modeling more complex patterns in the data that neither parent captures alone. This combination aims to enhance flexibility and potentially improve the log marginal likelihood by incorporating interactions that could lead to a better fit to the observed data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) with the rational quadratic (RQ) and periodic (PER) components. Since both parent kernels have the same LML score, this expression retains the interaction of RQ and PER while leveraging the smoothness of SE. By keeping the multiplication with SE, we maintain a strong overall smoothness that might improve the fit to the data. The expression directly reflects the structure of Parent 1, which shows potential synergy between RQ and PER, while aiming for the robustness provided by SE. This blend may result in a higher LML by capturing both periodic and varying length scales effectively.

Analysis: This kernel combines the components of both parent kernels while introducing an additional interaction term (RQ * PER). The term (SE * RQ) captures smoothness and generalization, (SE * PER) accommodates periodic patterns, and the added (RQ * PER) term allows for variations in scale across different periodic behaviors. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels to potentially improve the fit and thus increase the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE + RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative relationship of the SE and RQ kernels, which captures interactions with varying length scales, while also incorporating the additive nature of the SE and RQ combination. This hybrid approach aims to leverage both smoothness and varying characteristics of the data, potentially improving the fit and achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By separating the periodic component (PER) from the rational quadratic (RQ) and combining it directly with the squared exponential (SE), we allow the model to capture both the smoothness from SE and the long-range dependencies from RQ more effectively. Additionally, using multiplication with PER may help in capturing periodic behavior more robustly, potentially increasing the LML as it can better fit data that exhibits such patterns. This new configuration optimizes the contributions from each kernel by ensuring that SE serves both as a base and as an interaction term.

  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) + (SE + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: This modification simplifies the interaction between the kernels by removing the addition of the periodic kernel with the rational quadratic kernel, which may introduce unnecessary complexity. By focusing on the product of the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels, we capture smoothness and varying length scales effectively, while adding the periodic kernel separately allows for capturing periodic variations in the data. This separation can potentially lead to a better fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the additive structure of the first parent kernel, which captures smooth variations through the SE and RQ components, with the periodicity introduced by the PER kernel. By multiplying the additive kernel with the periodic kernel, we can account for both smooth trends and periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both parents while introducing new dynamics into the model.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (RQ + PER)) + (SE + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: By simplifying the interaction between the kernels, this expression focuses on the strengths of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel in conjunction with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels separately. This method reduces the complexity of interactions while still capturing the underlying patterns in the data, which may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood. The multiplication of SE with both RQ and PER can capture local smoothness and periodicity effectively while avoiding possible overfitting from the previous complex interactions.

  Parent 2: (SE + RQ) (LML: -1.290)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the advantages of both parent kernels by using the SE kernel as a base for both the RQ and PER characteristics. The term (SE * RQ) captures the ability of the Rational Quadratic to handle varying length scales while maintaining smoothness, while (SE * PER) introduces periodicity to the model. By summing these two components, the resulting kernel can leverage both the flexibility of RQ and the periodic nature of PER, potentially leading to a higher LML by better fitting complex data patterns.

  LLM Response:

Analysis: By simplifying the kernel and removing the additional SE term in the second part, we allow for a more balanced contribution from the periodic kernel (PER) while maintaining the interaction captured by the product of SE and RQ. This modification aims to reduce complexity and may improve the LML by enhancing the fit to periodic variations in the data while still leveraging the smoothness from the SE and RQ combination.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER) + (SE + RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the components of both parent kernels, retaining the interaction between the SE and RQ in the first part, while also including the periodicity from SE and PER. The addition of (SE + RQ) provides a flexible base that can capture varying characteristics of the data, potentially improving the fit and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood. By maintaining the structure of both parents, this kernel is likely to leverage the strengths of each, allowing for better modeling of the underlying data distribution.

Analysis: By simplifying the current kernel and focusing on the interaction between the Squared Exponential and Rational Quadratic kernels while adding the Periodic kernel separately, we can reduce complexity and potentially improve the fit to the data. This provides a good balance between capturing smooth variations (from SE and RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER), which may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER)) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with the sum of RQ and PER, which captures both the rational quadratic and periodic behaviors in the data. Additionally, by adding another term that multiplies SE with PER, we introduce more flexibility in modeling periodic fluctuations while still retaining the smoother characteristics of the SE kernel. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while potentially addressing their weaknesses, thereby improving the log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By simplifying the kernel and focusing on the interaction between SE and RQ, as well as SE and PER separately, this new expression reduces complexity while still incorporating the advantages of both periodic and rational behaviors. This approach can help capture more relevant patterns in the data without overfitting, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER)) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative structure of the first parent, which allows for capturing interactions between the different features, with the additive structure from the second parent. By multiplying SE with RQ and then adding it to the product of SE and the sum of RQ and PER, we introduce greater flexibility to model variations in the data while still leveraging the strengths of the base kernels. This combination aims to improve the LML by capturing both local and global patterns more effectively.

Analysis: By simplifying the kernel expression, we focus on the dominant interactions between the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels which often capture smoothness and varying length scales effectively. Adding the periodic kernel separately helps to account for any periodic patterns in the data without overly complicating the model, potentially leading to a higher LML by reducing the risk of overfitting.
