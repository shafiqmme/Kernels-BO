Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (PER * (RQ * SE)) (LML: -4946.359)
  Parent 2: ((PER + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.368)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * (SE + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with a mixture of the SE and RQ kernels to capture both smoothness and variations in the data. By adding SE and RQ, we aim to utilize the strengths of both kernels in modeling the underlying function, while keeping the periodic aspect of PER intact, which may help in capturing periodic patterns in the data. This combination is expected to enhance the flexibility and fitting capability of the kernel, potentially leading to a higher LML than the parents.
  Result: (PER * (SE + RQ))... LML=-4946.347
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (PER * (SE + RQ)) (LML: -4946.347)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By adding the SE kernel to the product of PER and RQ, we introduce an additional smoothness component that may capture variations in the data better. This combination allows the model to leverage the periodic nature of the PER kernel while still benefiting from the flexibility of the RQ kernel, potentially improving the LML compared to the original kernel structure.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by using the periodic kernel (PER) as a common factor. The term (SE * PER) captures the smoothness of the Squared Exponential kernel while incorporating the periodicity of the PER kernel. The additional term (RQ * PER) allows for capturing varying scales of input data, leveraging the Rational Quadratic kernel's ability to model data with different length scales. By combining these two components, we maintain a depth of 2 while aiming to improve the log marginal likelihood by effectively blending the characteristics of all base kernels involved.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * SE) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic structure of the PER kernel with both the smoothness of the SE and the flexibility of the RQ kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * SE)
Analysis: By combining the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, this expression captures both periodic patterns and general trend behavior in the data. This new kernel should retain the flexibility of the PER while benefiting from the smoothness of SE, potentially leading to a higher LML than both parent kernels. It adheres to the depth constraint and simplifies the structure while attempting to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels.

  Parent 2: (PER * (SE + RQ)) (LML: -4946.347)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * (SE + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodicity from the PER kernel with the flexibility of both the SE and RQ kernels through addition. Since Parent 2 already shows a higher LML than Parent 1, maintaining the structure of (PER * (SE + RQ)) allows us to leverage the strengths of both base kernels while ensuring that we remain within the depth constraint. This configuration may help to better capture variations in the data while also maintaining periodic behavior.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodicity from the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using the multiplication of PER with SE and RQ separately and adding them, we aim to capture both the periodic structures and the varying smoothness in the data. This approach leverages the strengths of both parent kernels while maintaining a simple structure within the depth limit, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (PER * RQ)... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (PER * (SE + RQ)) (LML: -4946.347)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By modifying the kernel to first combine the SE kernel with the product of the PER and RQ kernels, we allow for a smoother fit that can capture both the periodic behavior from PER and the varying scale from RQ. This configuration may help in improving the LML by leveraging the strengths of both base kernels while simplifying the interaction between them, potentially leading to a better fit to the observed data.

  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ * RQ)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by adding the SE and RQ base kernels together, which can enhance the flexibility in capturing varying behaviors in the data. The resulting sum is then multiplied by the periodic kernel (PER), allowing the model to account for periodicity while also incorporating the smoothness properties of the SE and RQ kernels. This combination may lead to a better fit to the data and potentially a higher LML than either parent kernel alone.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER)... LML=-4946.342

  Parent 2: (PER * SE) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by adding the squared exponential (SE) and periodic (PER) kernels, and then multiplying the result by SE. The addition allows for capturing variations introduced by periodicity from PER while still leveraging the smoothness of SE. This combination may improve the fit to the data by addressing both the smooth trends and periodic structures, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.
  Result: ((SE + PER) * SE)... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.342)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By switching the multiplication operator to combine RQ with PER, we allow for a modulation of the periodic behavior by the rational quadratic kernel. This can capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially improving the fit and thus the log marginal likelihood. The addition of SE ensures that we still include a smooth component while allowing for the flexibility of the periodic and rational quadratic interactions. This structure maintains the depth constraint while possibly enhancing model expressiveness.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * SE) + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using addition, we allow the model to leverage the strengths of both the original parent kernels, potentially capturing both periodicity and varying smoothness in the data. This combination aims to improve the fit to the observed data and possibly achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((PER * SE) + RQ)... LML=-4946.362
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.342)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By modifying the kernel to incorporate a product of the periodic kernel (PER) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we can introduce more flexibility in capturing periodic variations with the ability to account for varying scales in the data. This combination may improve the LML by allowing the model to better fit the underlying structure of the observed data, particularly if there are periodic patterns that vary in amplitude or length.

  Parent 2: (SE * (RQ * RQ)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By keeping the SE * PER component from Parent 1, it retains the ability to model non-stationary patterns. Adding the RQ * RQ term introduces additional flexibility in modeling varying scales of smoothness, potentially capturing more complex structures in the data. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, which might help in achieving a higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * SE + SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic structure of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel while also including a direct SE component. By adding the SE kernel, we aim to improve the model's flexibility and potentially capture more variability in the data. This expression keeps the depth at 2 and may leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to achieve a better fit, thus aiming for a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodic characteristics from the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By using the SE kernel in two different multiplicative contexts, it captures both the periodic behavior and the varying scales of the data, potentially improving the LML by leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels while staying within the depth constraint.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the RQ kernel's ability to capture varying smoothness. By using the SE kernel with RQ in conjunction with PER, we aim to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially improving the fit to the data and achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential kernel (SE) with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) using addition, which captures local smoothness from SE while incorporating the variability of RQ. The resulting product with SE aims to balance the strengths of both parents, potentially improving the representation of the underlying data structure and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). By avoiding deep nesting, this expression remains within the specified depth limit while exploring a promising combination of the two kernels.

    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by maintaining the additive interaction between the SE and RQ kernels while incorporating the multiplicative aspect of RQ. The use of RQ as a multiplicative factor can help to capture varying length scales and improve flexibility, potentially leading to better fitting of the data and a higher LML than either parent kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel while directly adding the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using multiplication between SE and PER, we capture the combined effects of smoothness and periodic variation, while adding RQ allows for accommodating non-stationarity in the data. This balanced approach may lead to improved LML by effectively leveraging the strengths of both periodic and smooth components.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.342)
  LLM Response:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the flexibility of both the SE and RQ kernels. By adding SE and PER together first, we can capture both smoothness and periodic behavior, which could enhance the model's expressiveness. Multiplying this combination by RQ allows for additional flexibility in modeling varying length-scale behavior, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels. The structure remains within the depth limit while aiming to leverage the strengths of all involved kernels.

The SE kernel captures smooth variations, while the RQ kernel adds flexibility for varying length scales. This combination could lead to a better fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML compared to the previous expression.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel through multiplication, while also including the flexibility of the RQ kernel through addition. By using (SE * PER), we aim to capture both the smooth and periodic features of the data, and adding RQ allows the model to adjust for any variance that might not be fully explained by the first two kernels.
