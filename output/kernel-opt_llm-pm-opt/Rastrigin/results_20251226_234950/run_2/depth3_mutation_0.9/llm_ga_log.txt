  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + PER)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (RQ + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel to model varying smoothness with the Squared Exponential (SE) and Periodic (PER) kernel. By adding SE multiplied by PER, it allows for capturing periodic patterns while ensuring smoothness, potentially improving the fit to the data compared to both parent kernels. This balanced approach seeks to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while respecting the depth constraint.
  Result: (RQ + (SE * PER))... LML=-4946.360
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (SE * PER)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic structure provided by the PER kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using addition and multiplication, it allows the model to capture both local variations through the SE and longer periodic patterns through the PER and RQ. This combination may improve the fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE * (SE * PER)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parents by leveraging the squared exponential (SE) kernel, which provides smoothness, and the periodic (PER) kernel, which captures periodic patterns. The expression (SE * PER) allows for smooth variations that are also periodic, while adding (SE * SE) enhances the overall smoothness of the model. This combination should help to better fit the data and potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood by allowing for both local smoothness and periodic behavior.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (SE * SE)... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE * (SE * PER)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (SE * RQ))
Analysis: By adding the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel to the product of SE and the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, we introduce more flexibility in modeling the data. The combination allows for capturing both smooth variations (from SE) and more complex variations (from RQ) while maintaining a simple structure. This could potentially improve the fit to the observed data, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: (SE + (SE * RQ))... LML=-4946.358

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: (SE * (PER + PER)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (RQ + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel with the product of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Periodic (PER) kernels, which was already a part of Parent 1. The goal is to maintain the effective structure of Parent 1, which showed a relatively better LML score compared to Parent 2. By keeping the RQ kernel, we introduce flexibility in modeling varying length scales, while the SE * PER combination captures both smoothness and periodicity. This should help in achieving a better fit to the data.
  Result: (RQ + (SE * PER))... LML=-4946.360
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (SE * RQ)) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The current kernel combines the SE with a product of SE and RQ, which may be overly complex for the given data. By simplifying the expression to just the addition of SE and a periodic kernel (PER), we allow for both smoothness and periodicity, which can better capture variations in the data without adding unnecessary complexity. This could potentially lead to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) as it retains the flexibility of the SE kernel while introducing periodicity, which might fit the underlying data patterns more effectively.

  Parent 2: (SE + PER) (LML: -4946.336)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (SE + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and PER kernels, which can capture varying smoothness and periodicity, with the additive combination of SE and PER, allowing for greater flexibility in fitting the data. By leveraging both multiplication and addition, this expression aims to harness the strengths of both parent kernels while adhering to the depth constraint. This may improve the log marginal likelihood by balancing the benefits of each parent’s structure.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (SE + PER)... LML=-4946.351
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + PER) (LML: -4946.336)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: By multiplying the existing kernel (SE + PER) with the RQ kernel, we introduce flexibility in the length-scale and variance of the combined kernel. The RQ kernel can help model varying degrees of smoothness and capture broader patterns in the data, potentially improving the LML compared to the additive combination alone.
  Result: ((SE + PER) * RQ)... LML=-4946.310

  Parent 2: (SE * PER) + (SE + PER) (LML: -4946.351)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by maintaining the influential aspects of the RQ kernel while also incorporating periodic behavior from the PER kernel. By multiplying RQ with both SE and PER, we aim to capture the smoothness and flexibility of the RQ kernel along with the periodicity, potentially improving the fit to the data while remaining within the depth constraint.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)... LML=-4946.380
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By modifying the kernel expression to place the periodic component (PER) as a multiplicative factor with the rational quadratic (RQ), we allow the model to capture variations that have both periodic behavior and varying smoothness. This combination can improve the flexibility of the kernel, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood on the observed data.

  Parent 2: (SE + PER) (LML: -4946.336)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) and periodic (PER) components through multiplication. The rationale behind this choice is that it captures the smoothness of the SE kernel while also incorporating the periodic behavior of the PER kernel, potentially addressing the limitations of both parent kernels. By focusing on their interaction, we might achieve a better fit to the observed data, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).
  Result: (SE * PER)... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 2

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This modification retains the periodic structure while allowing the rational quadratic kernel to modulate the periodic component. By using the addition of SE, we can capture both smoothness and periodicity without overly complicating the kernel expression. This combination may provide a better fit to the data, potentially leading to an increase in the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-4946.583

  Parent 2: (SE * (SE * PER)) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the exponential decay of the SE kernel with the periodicity of the PER kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding PER and RQ, we can capture periodic fluctuations while maintaining the smoothness provided by the SE kernel. The multiplication with SE ensures that the overall behavior is dictated by the smoothness and continuity of the SE kernel, potentially improving the fit to the data and achieving a higher LML.
  Result: (SE * (PER + RQ))... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: The current kernel expression combines the squared exponential and periodic kernels with a rational quadratic kernel, which may introduce unnecessary complexity for the data. By simplifying the kernel to just the sum of the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels, we retain flexibility while potentially improving the fit. Both SE and RQ are capable of capturing smoothness and varying length scales, which may better suit the underlying structure of the data, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE * PER) + (SE + PER) (LML: -4946.351)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the strength of the RQ kernel while also incorporating the multiplicative interaction between SE and PER. The addition of the RQ kernel aims to introduce flexibility in capturing variations that might not be fully addressed by the product of SE and PER alone. This hybrid approach leverages both the periodic nature and the smoothness from the RQ kernel, potentially leading to an improved fit and higher log marginal likelihood compared to the given parent kernels.
  Result: ((SE * PER) + RQ)... LML=-4946.360
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: By focusing on the combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, we leverage the smoothness of SE while incorporating the flexibility of RQ, which can model varying length scales. The periodic component (PER) may not be necessary if the data does not exhibit periodic behavior, thus simplifying the kernel may lead to improved LML.
  Result: (SE + RQ)... LML=-4946.377

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by utilizing the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel to capture smoothness and variability in the data while also incorporating the Rational Quadratic (RQ) and Periodic (PER) kernels in a way that allows for varying length scales and periodic behavior. By placing RQ and PER within an addition, we can model both smooth and periodic structures, which may lead to improved fitting compared to the individual parent kernels, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood. The structure maintains a depth of 3 and is designed to leverage the unique characteristics of both parents.
  Result: (SE * (RQ + PER))... LML=-4946.359

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By modifying the kernel to prioritize the periodic behavior in combination with the rational quadratic kernel, we can capture both local variations (through the SE component) and periodic structures more effectively. This adjustment aims to enhance flexibility in modeling while potentially improving the LML score.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-4946.583

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) and the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) without introducing additional complexity. The addition of RQ allows for capturing varying smoothness, while SE maintains a strong baseline fit. This simple expression remains within the depth constraint and may yield a higher LML due to its balanced nature.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive component of both parent kernels to leverage the strengths of the SE and PER kernels, while also introducing a multiplicative factor of SE. By multiplying the sum of SE and PER with SE, we aim to capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodicity of the PER kernel, potentially leading to a better fit for the observed data and an increase in the log marginal likelihood. The depth remains within the allowed limit of 3.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the structure of the kernel to emphasize the contribution of the periodic component multiplied by the rational quadratic, we may capture more complex patterns in the data that the original kernel might have missed. This adjustment allows the periodic behavior to interact with the longer-range correlations provided by the rational quadratic, potentially improving the LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and PER kernels with the additive interaction of both the SE and PER kernels multiplied by the RQ kernel. By leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels, it aims to capture both smooth variations (from SE) and periodic behaviors (from PER), while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This combination may provide a better fit to the data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood than either parent.

Analysis: By combining the periodic kernel (PER) with the squared exponential kernel (SE), we can capture both periodic variations and smoothness in the data. This combination may improve the fit compared to using the periodic kernel alone, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The SE kernel adds flexibility to model non-periodic trends that may be present in the data, which could enhance the overall performance of the kernel.

Analysis: Combining the periodic kernel (PER) with the squared exponential kernel (SE) through multiplication allows the model to capture both periodic behavior and smooth variations simultaneously. Given that PER alone has a better LML than the combination of PER and SE, this product form could leverage the strengths of both kernels while maintaining a competitive fit to the data. This approach can potentially increase the flexibility of the model and improve the LML.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (PER + SE) (LML: -76.696)
  Parent 2: PER (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * SE)
Analysis: Combining the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel through multiplication can capture both periodic patterns and smooth variations in the data. This kernel may achieve a higher LML by leveraging the strengths of both base kernels, as PER alone has shown a promising LML, and SE can enhance the overall fit.
  Result: (PER * SE)... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 2

Mutation:
  Current best: PER (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the existing Periodic (PER) kernel, we can capture both smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data. The SE kernel can enhance the overall flexibility of the model, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) score by allowing for better fitting to non-periodic trends while still accommodating the periodic structure.
  Result: (SE + PER)... LML=-4946.336
  Kernel depth: 2
