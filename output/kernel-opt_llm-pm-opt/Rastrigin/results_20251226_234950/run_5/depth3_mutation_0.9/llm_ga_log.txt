  Parent 2: ((RQ * SE) * RQ) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodicity of the PER kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding SE to the product of PER and RQ, we aim to leverage the strengths of both parents. The addition of SE allows for a smooth fit while the product captures the periodic variations modulated by RQ, which may help improve the log marginal likelihood over the parent kernels.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-4946.583
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * SE) * SE) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with a product of the Periodic (PER) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, we introduce flexibility in capturing both smoothness (from SE) and periodic behavior (from PER) while also allowing for varying length scales (from RQ). This combination may enhance the model's ability to fit the observed data more effectively, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the original kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * SE) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding the two expressions, we aim to capture both periodic patterns and variations in the data while maintaining a level of smoothness. This combination may leverage the strengths of all three kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) due to increased expressiveness in modeling the underlying function.

  Parent 2: ((RQ * SE) * RQ) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) with the periodic behavior of the Periodic (PER) kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. By allowing the periodic component to modulate the influence of the RQ kernel, it captures both local variations and long-range dependencies, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood (LML) by leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels without exceeding the depth constraint.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * SE) * SE) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels through addition, which can help capture both smoothness and varying length scales. The product with the Periodic (PER) kernel allows for modeling periodic patterns while incorporating the flexibility of the other kernels. This combination may enhance the model's ability to fit the data and potentially improve the log marginal likelihood compared to the previous kernel expression.

  Parent 2: (PER + (SE * RQ)) (LML: -4946.362)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER + (SE * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By using (SE * SE), we maintain the smoothness and flexibility that the SE kernel provides while also incorporating the periodic nature from the PER kernel. This expression is simple and respects the depth constraint, potentially balancing the strengths of both parent kernels to achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (PER + (SE * SE))... LML=-4946.362
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This expression combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the interaction of RQ and periodicity from PER. By placing RQ in a multiplicative relationship with PER, it allows for capturing both the long-range correlations from RQ and the periodic structure from PER. This can potentially improve the fit to data by better modeling variations that exhibit both periodic and non-periodic behavior, which may lead to an increase in LML compared to the original kernel.

  Parent 2: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (SE * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, while also incorporating the smoothness of the SE kernel. By multiplying PER with RQ, we aim to capture both periodic behavior and varying smoothness, which may improve the fit to the data compared to the parent kernels. Additionally, the inclusion of SE multiplied by RQ allows for a smooth transition across the data, potentially enhancing the overall LML. This expression remains within the depth constraint and leverages the strengths of each parent kernel.
  Result: ((PER * RQ) + (SE * RQ))... LML=-4946.366

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This modification introduces interaction between the periodic kernel (PER) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), which can capture both periodic trends and varying smoothness in the data. By using addition with the squared exponential (SE), this kernel may better accommodate localized variations while still modeling periodic behavior, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (PER + (SE * SE)) (LML: -4946.362)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER + (SE * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the squared exponential aspect of SE, while maintaining a simple structure that is already known to yield a competitive LML score. By ensuring the structure is not deeply nested, we retain the potential for good generalization while leveraging the strengths of both parents. The added multiplication of SE could enhance the fit to non-stationary patterns in the data.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This modified kernel combines the SE kernel with a product of the RQ and PER kernels. The multiplication of RQ and PER may capture more complex interactions in periodic data, potentially leading to improved flexibility and better fitting of the observed data, thus increasing the LML.

  Parent 2: (PER + (SE * SE)) (LML: -4946.362)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER + (SE * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression is identical to Parent 1, which already has a strong LML score of -4946.362. Given that both Parent 1 and Parent 2 have the same LML score, I chose to retain the combination of the periodic kernel (PER) with the interaction of the squared exponential kernel (SE) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ). This combination is likely to capture both smoothness and periodicity in the data. Since any modification to the structure while maintaining depth constraints may not yield better results, retaining this expression seems a prudent strategy.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By replacing the multiplication of PER with RQ, this expression allows the periodic component to modulate the effects of the rational quadratic kernel, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data. This modification may enhance the model's flexibility and lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (RQ * PER))... LML=-4946.492

  Parent 2: ((RQ * SE) * RQ) (LML: -4946.359)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * SE) + (RQ * SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity from the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. The addition operator allows for capturing both periodic and non-periodic variations in the data, potentially improving the overall fit and maximizing the log marginal likelihood. By keeping the depth to 2, it remains within the constraint while leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels.
  Result: (PER * SE) + (RQ * SE)... LML=-4946.361
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By changing the order of operations and combining RQ with PER, we allow the rational quadratic component to contribute to the periodic behavior in a multiplicative manner. This may better capture the underlying structure of the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the original expression.
  Result: (SE + (RQ * PER))... LML=-4946.492

  Parent 2: (PER * SE) + (RQ * SE) (LML: -4946.361)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * SE) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This expression takes the combination from Parent 2, which already performs well, and retains the multiplicative interaction between the periodic and squared exponential kernels from Parent 1. By leveraging both the additive and multiplicative structures, this kernel could capture the strengths of periodic variations while still maintaining the smoothness from the SE kernel. This balanced approach may enhance the fit to the observed data, potentially leading to a higher LML.
  Result: ((PER * SE) + (RQ * SE))... LML=-4946.361
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels via multiplication. This combination can capture both smoothness (from SE) and varying length scales (from RQ), potentially providing a better fit for the data. By simplifying the structure and removing the periodic component, we may reduce noise and improve the log marginal likelihood, as the previous kernel's complexity might have introduced overfitting or instability in LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * SE) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic characteristics of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying SE with RQ, we allow for varying length scales, which can help model more complex patterns in the data, while maintaining the periodic nature provided by PER. This expression stays within the depth limit and may leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to improve the LML.
  Result: (PER * SE) + (SE * RQ)... LML=-4946.359
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By changing the structure of the kernel, this expression allows the Rational Quadratic kernel to modulate the periodic behavior of the Perodic kernel. This may help capture the variance in the data more effectively compared to the previous formulation, potentially increasing the LML. The combination of SE and RQ with PER might better account for both smooth and periodic patterns in the observed data.

Analysis: By focusing on the product of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, this expression captures both smoothness and varying length scales more effectively without the periodic component, which may be introducing unnecessary complexity or noise into the model. This simpler kernel structure could better fit the data and potentially yield a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel is identical to Parent 1, which has the highest LML score among the provided options. By combining the periodic nature of PER with the flexibility of SE and the additional capability of RQ, it captures a broader range of patterns in the data. This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1 while ensuring the depth constraint is satisfied.

Analysis: This kernel expression is identical to Parent 1 and retains both components, (PER * SE) and (SE * RQ), which may capture periodic behavior and the rational quadratic adaptability. By using the addition operator, it combines the strengths of both kernels, potentially enhancing the model's flexibility and achieving a higher LML than either parent alone. Given that the LML values are the same for both parents, this expression can serve as a baseline for further exploration, maintaining a simple depth of 2.

Analysis: This kernel expression combines the second parent kernel, which already has a strong LML score, by integrating the RQ kernel with the SE kernel. By leveraging the periodic nature of the PER kernel in combination with the smoothness of the SE and the flexibility of the RQ, this expression aims to capture a broader range of patterns in the data. It maintains a depth of 2, ensuring simplicity while maximizing the potential for higher LML compared to the parents.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (PER * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the second parent’s effective use of the RQ kernel with the periodic behavior of the PER kernel while also incorporating the SE kernel's smoothness. By adding the product of PER and SE to the mix, we aim to capture both periodicity and the smooth variations of the data, which could lead to a better fit and potentially a higher log marginal likelihood than either parent.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * SE) * SE) (LML: -4946.359)
  Parent 2: ((SE + RQ) * (PER + RQ)) (LML: -4946.327)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE and RQ kernels with the periodic behavior of the PER kernel. By adding SE and RQ, we can enhance flexibility in capturing variations in the data, while multiplying by the PER kernel ensures that we still account for periodic patterns. This structure aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while maintaining a manageable complexity within the depth constraint.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the structure to combine the periodic kernel with the rational quadratic kernel, we can allow for more flexibility in capturing periodicity while still leveraging the smoothness provided by the squared exponential kernel. This might improve LML by better fitting the underlying patterns in the data, as the interaction between PER and RQ could provide a better representation of the data's variability.

  Parent 2: (SE + (SE * RQ)) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive nature of the first parent with the periodic structure of the second parent. By using (SE + RQ) as a base that captures smooth variations and combining it with PER, we aim to leverage the strengths of both periodic and smooth behaviors, potentially increasing the fit to the observed data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood. The depth remains within the allowed limit of 3.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER)... LML=-4946.337
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: By simplifying the kernel to just the sum of the Squared Exponential (SE) and the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, we reduce complexity while maintaining flexibility in fitting the data. This combination may capture both smoothness (from SE) and varying length scales (from RQ), potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the more complex current kernel expression.

  Parent 2: (SE + (SE * RQ)) (LML: -4946.358)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive effect of the SE and RQ kernels from Parent 1 with the periodicity introduced by the PER kernel. By retaining the multiplicative structure, we leverage the strengths of both parents while simplifying the overall complexity. This configuration may provide a better fit by capturing both local variations (from SE and RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER). Given that both parent kernels are closely related in terms of LML scores, this new combination aims to enhance the model's flexibility without exceeding the depth constraint.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER)... LML=-4946.366
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the structure of the kernel, this expression allows for the periodicity to be scaled by the rational quadratic kernel, which can capture variations in the data more effectively. The addition of the squared exponential kernel can provide a smooth overall fit while maintaining flexibility from the periodic and rational components, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive strengths of SE and PER while interacting multiplicatively with RQ. By leveraging the periodic nature of PER with the smoothness of SE and the flexibility of RQ, this expression aims to capture both local and global patterns in the data. It maintains a manageable depth of 3 and seeks to balance the characteristics of both parent kernels to potentially enhance the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:

Analysis: By simplifying the kernel to just the combination of the Squared Exponential and the Rational Quadratic kernels, we may capture the smoothness of the data without the potential overfitting introduced by the periodic kernel. This can lead to better generalization and potentially higher log marginal likelihood, especially if the data is not periodic in nature.

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the SE and RQ kernels, which can help capture both smooth variations (SE) and varying scales of variation (RQ), while also introducing periodicity through the PER kernel. By adding SE and RQ, we can exploit their complementary properties before multiplying by the periodic kernel, potentially allowing the model to fit more complex patterns in the data that were not captured by the original parent kernels. This structure remains within the depth limit of 3.
  Result: Invalid kernel (LML too low)

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -4946.310)
  LLM Response:

Analysis: This modification retains the periodic nature of the PER kernel while allowing the rational quadratic kernel to modulate the output through multiplication. This combination can capture both local smoothness (from SE) and periodic patterns influenced by RQ, potentially improving the fit to the data and thus increasing the LML compared to the original expression.
