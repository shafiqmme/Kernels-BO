Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * SE)) (LML: -4946.360)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodicity captured by the first parent kernel, which includes the term (PER * PER), with the smoothness and flexibility provided by the squared exponential (SE) multiplied with the periodic kernel (PER). By integrating periodic behavior with the smoothness of SE, this kernel may better accommodate data that exhibit both periodic patterns and smooth variations, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood compared to the parents.

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * SE)) (LML: -4946.360)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic nature of the first parent with the smoothness from the squared exponential kernel in the second parent. By using the multiplication of PER with SE, we can introduce periodic behavior modulated by the smoothness of SE, which could capture more complex patterns in the data. The addition of the periodic kernel squared ensures that we maintain the richness of periodic features while enhancing the overall flexibility of the kernel, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (RQ * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -4946.381)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior from Parent 1 with the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic kernel from Parent 2. By using the product of PER and RQ, we can capture variations that may not be purely periodic while still retaining the periodicity from the squared periodic term. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels for improved LML performance by allowing the model to fit oscillatory patterns with varying amplitudes and frequencies.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * PER)) (LML: -4946.391)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel, which is evident in both parent kernels, with the smoothness introduced by the SE kernel. The addition of the SE kernel is likely to enhance the flexibility of the overall kernel, allowing it to better fit variations in the data while retaining periodic characteristics. This approach aims to balance the strengths of both parent kernels while potentially improving the log marginal likelihood (LML) score.
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))... LML=-4946.405
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The current kernel expression emphasizes periodic patterns due to the repeated use of the PER kernel, which might lead to overfitting in some cases. By replacing the kernel with a combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Periodic (PER) kernels, we introduce smoothness and flexibility with SE while retaining some periodicity. This balanced approach could capture a wider range of behaviors in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + PER)))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic structure of Parent 1, which captures repetitive patterns, with the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel from Parent 2, which can model varying smoothness. By summing the contributions from both components, the new kernel aims to leverage the strengths of periodicity and varying scales, potentially improving the model's ability to fit the observed data and thus achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * SE)) (LML: -4946.360)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic structure of Parent 1, which captures periodic patterns effectively, with the smoothness of the SE kernel, which aids in modeling overall trends in the data. By using both the multiplication of PER with itself and the addition of SE multiplied by PER, this new kernel aims to leverage the strengths of both periodicity and smoothness, potentially leading to an improved fit and higher LML.
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))... LML=-4946.405
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: The original kernel contains a high degree of periodicity due to the (PER * PER) term, which may not capture the overall trend effectively. By replacing the outer addition with SE, we introduce a smooth component that can help model the underlying data trend while retaining the periodic structure. This combination is likely to enhance the flexibility of the kernel, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already has a better LML score (-1.402) compared to Parent 2 (-1.500). By preserving the SE component, we introduce smoothness to the kernel, which can help capture trends in the data, while the (PER * PER) component retains the periodic characteristics. This combination is likely to improve the fit by leveraging the strengths of both components, particularly the smoothness from SE and the periodicity from (PER * PER).
  Result: (SE + (PER * PER))... LML=-1.402
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By replacing one instance of the periodic kernel (PER) with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we introduce flexibility in modeling varying lengths of scale across the data while still capturing periodic patterns. This combination is likely to provide a better fit to the data than using two PER kernels alone, which may overfit to noise in periodic components. The additional flexibility of the RQ kernel can help in increasing the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-4946.583

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel, which provides smoothness and flexibility, with the periodic kernel (PER) structure from both parents. By adding both the periodic component and the squared exponential, we aim to capture both smooth variations and periodic behaviors in the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood beyond the scores of the parent kernels. The inclusion of an additional PER term may help in capturing more intricate periodic patterns, which could lead to a better fit.
  Result: (SE + (PER * PER) + PER)... LML=-4946.178
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: The original kernel uses a combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) and a periodic kernel multiplied by itself (PER * PER), which may not capture the underlying structure of the data effectively. By replacing the periodic component with a Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, we allow for greater flexibility in modeling variations in the data while still leveraging the smoothness of the SE kernel. This combination can potentially provide a better fit and thus improve the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + ((PER * PER) + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the effective properties of both parent kernels by integrating the squared exponential (SE) to capture smoothness and a combination of periodic components from the parent (PER * PER) and the additional PER term. This structure allows for capturing both periodicity and smooth variations, potentially leading to a better fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the individual parent kernels. By including both the SE kernel for smoothness and the periodic components in a hierarchical structure, it aims to balance the influences of periodicity and non-periodic variations, which could enhance the overall model performance.
  Result: (SE + ((PER * PER) + PER))... LML=-4946.178
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By replacing one instance of the periodic kernel (PER) with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we can introduce more flexibility into the model. The rational quadratic kernel can capture varying length scales, which may better fit the data's underlying structure compared to using two periodic kernels. This modification aims to improve the model's ability to adapt to different patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression retains the structure of Parent 1, which has a relatively high LML of -1.402. By keeping the SE component, we incorporate the smoothness and flexibility of the Squared Exponential kernel, while also utilizing the periodic nature captured by the (PER * PER) term. This combination aims to leverage both the local smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodic structure of the PER kernel, potentially leading to a better fit than both Parent 1 and Parent 2.
  Result: (SE + (PER * PER))... LML=-1.402
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: By replacing the double periodic kernel (PER * PER) with a Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, we introduce a more flexible structure that can model varying smoothness in the data. The RQ kernel can capture more diverse patterns in the data than the repeated periodic kernel, which may have been too restrictive. This change should help improve the log marginal likelihood (LML) by allowing for better fitting to the underlying structure of the observed data.
  Result: (SE + RQ)... LML=-4946.377

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic kernel (PER) in a way that captures both smoothness and periodicity. By adding the base periodic component (PER) to the combination of the two periodic kernels, we leverage the periodicity inherent in both parents while also incorporating the smoothness from the SE kernel. This hybrid approach may improve the fit to the data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood due to the added flexibility.
  Result: (SE + (PER * PER) + PER)... LML=-4946.178
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: The proposed kernel replaces the double periodic kernel (PER * PER) with a Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, which can model varying length scales more effectively. This change is expected to enhance flexibility in capturing the data's underlying structure, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the original kernel. The addition of the RQ kernel can also help address any non-stationarity in the data that the periodic component may not have captured adequately.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * (PER + 1)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) with a modified periodic kernel that enhances the periodicity through multiplication with an additional constant. The addition of the SE kernel is likely to improve the overall smoothness and flexibility of the model, while the periodic component captures any seasonal patterns effectively. By introducing the constant in the periodic term, we allow for a more nuanced fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than both parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel is the same as Parent 1, which had an LML score of -1.402. By including the SE component, we introduce a smoothness that may help the model fit the data better while still retaining the periodic behavior captured by the (PER * PER) term. This combination is expected to leverage the strengths of both smoothness from the SE kernel and the periodicity from the PER components, potentially leading to an improved LML score.

Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which had a higher LML than Parent 2. By keeping the squared exponential (SE) component, we leverage its ability to model smoothness and continuity, while the (PER * PER) component captures periodic behavior effectively. This combination aims to enhance the overall fit by incorporating both smooth trends and periodic variations, potentially achieving a higher LML than either parent.

Analysis: This kernel takes the structure of Parent 1, which already has a higher LML score (-1.402) compared to Parent 2 (-1.500). By retaining the SE component, we introduce smoothness while preserving the periodic characteristics from the (PER * PER) term. This combination is likely to capture both the local variation from the SE kernel and the periodic patterns from the PER kernel, potentially leading to an improved fit and a higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) with the periodic kernel squared (PER * PER) from Parent 1, which already shows a better LML score compared to Parent 2. By keeping SE, we leverage its smoothness properties while maintaining the periodicity provided by the squared periodic kernel. This combination should enhance the model's ability to fit data with both smooth trends and periodic structures, potentially resulting in an improved log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: By replacing one of the periodic kernels in the expression with a rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we introduce an additional flexibility in the modeling of the data. The RQ kernel can capture varying lengths scales, which may improve the fit compared to the original expression that only used periodic components. The combination of the SE kernel with a more versatile periodic and rational quadratic structure may enhance the overall model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic nature of the PER kernels from both parent kernels. By adding SE, we leverage its ability to capture general trends in the data, while the term ((PER * PER) * PER) enhances the model's capability to capture more complex periodic patterns.

Analysis: The original kernel combines a squared exponential term with a periodic term multiplied by itself, which may not capture the data's characteristics effectively. By replacing the periodic component with a rational quadratic (RQ) kernel, we introduce a flexibility in modeling varying lengths scales, which can help better fit the data and potentially increase the log marginal likelihood (LML). The SE kernel captures smoothness, while RQ accommodates varying smoothness across the input space, possibly leading to an improved model fit.

Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel, which is known for its smoothness and flexibility, with the periodic components of the parent kernels. By adding both the squared periodic kernel (PER * PER) and the single periodic kernel (PER), we aim to capture both long-range trends and periodic variations in the data.

    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The current kernel contains a periodic component squared, which may introduce unnecessary complexity and could lead to overfitting. By simplifying the kernel to just (SE + PER), we retain the smoothness of the squared exponential while also capturing periodicity without the added complexity of squaring the periodic kernel. This balance may improve the fit to the data and potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + (PER * (PER * PER)))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the SE component, which captures smooth variations, with the periodic components from both parents. By retaining the term (PER * PER) and modifying the third component to (PER * (PER * PER)), it aims to leverage the periodic structure while ensuring sufficient flexibility in the model. This formulation maintains the existing structure that produced a competitive LML and may introduce new interactions that can enhance the fit to the data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the SE component from Parent 1, ensuring smoothness and continuity, with the simpler periodic terms from both parents. By retaining the (PER * PER) term and adding the (PER * (PER * PER)), we allow for more flexibility in modeling periodic behavior while avoiding excessive complexity that could lead to overfitting.

Analysis: This kernel combines the SE kernel with the second-order periodic kernel (PER * PER) and retains the cubic periodic interaction term ((PER * PER) * PER) that was present in Parent 2. By omitting the less impactful term (PER * (PER * PER)), we simplify the kernel while still leveraging the complexity introduced by the higher-order periodic interactions.

By replacing the periodic components with a Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, we introduce a kernel that can capture varying levels of smoothness, which may lead to a better fit. The RQ kernel is also less prone to overfitting compared to the squared exponential or periodic-only combinations, and thus is likely to maximize the log marginal likelihood more effectively.

Retaining the (PER * PER) term captures the oscillatory behavior while adding the ((PER * PER) * PER) term from Parent 1 allows for more complex periodic interactions. The additional complexity introduced by these periodic terms, along with the smoothness of SE, may enhance the model's ability to fit the observed data better, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1.402)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: By replacing the periodic component with the Rational Quadratic kernel, we introduce a more flexible model that can capture varying lengths of correlations in the data. The Rational Quadratic kernel can adapt to different scales of variation, which may lead to a better fit than the squared periodic component. This simplification can also help in avoiding overfitting that may arise from the product of two periodic kernels. As a result, this kernel combination is expected to yield a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + (PER * (SE * PER)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the Squared Exponential kernel with the existing periodic components and introduces an interaction term between the periodic kernel and the SE kernel. By including the term (PER * (SE * PER)), we allow for a more complex interaction that can capture both smoothness from the SE and periodicity, potentially leading to a better fit and improved log marginal likelihood. This construction aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while adding a new dimension to the periodic behavior.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * (PER + PER)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential kernel (SE) with a modification of the periodic kernel. By using (PER + PER), we increase the flexibility of the periodic component, allowing it to capture more complex periodic patterns in the data. This combination aims to leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while enhancing the periodicity through a strengthened periodic component, potentially leading to an improved fit and higher LML compared to the parent kernels.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By replacing one instance of the periodic kernel (PER) with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we introduce additional flexibility to model variations in the data that are not purely periodic. The RQ kernel can capture varying smoothness, which may help account for any irregularities in the observed data, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + (PER * (PER * PER)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the elements of both parent kernels while removing the redundant term from Parent 1, namely ((PER * PER) * PER). By retaining the interaction between the PER components and the SE kernel, it aims to capture both the smoothness from the SE kernel and the periodic behavior from the PER components, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:

Analysis: The addition of the RQ kernel introduces a capability to model varying length scales, which can improve the fit to the data compared to using a periodic component squared. The RQ kernel's flexibility might capture non-stationary behavior better than the squared periodic component, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + (PER * (PER * PER)) + ((PER * PER) * PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel retains all components from Parent 1, which includes the additional term (PER * (PER * PER)). By incorporating this term along with the other elements, we maintain the potential for capturing complex periodic behaviors while leveraging the smoothness of the SE kernel. Since both parents achieved the same LML, this kernel aims to maximize the potential of the richer structure in Parent 1 without losing any beneficial contributions.

Analysis: By replacing one of the periodic kernels with a rational quadratic kernel, we introduce a component that can better capture varying levels of smoothness in the data. The rational quadratic kernel can model the non-stationarity in the data more effectively than a product of periodic kernels alone, which may lead to an increase in the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER) + ((PER * PER) * PER) + (PER * (PER * PER)))

Analysis: The proposed kernel combines components from both parent kernels, maintaining all existing elements while ensuring the structure remains coherent. By preserving the addition of the SE (squared exponential) kernel, which provides flexibility in fitting the data, and retaining the complexity introduced by the different compositions of the periodic (PER) kernel, this formulation aims to leverage their strengths. Since both parent kernels yielded the same LML, this combination could explore a broader range of interactions between the periodic components, potentially improving the fit and achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.
