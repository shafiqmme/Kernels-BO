  Parent 2: ((PER + PER) + RQ) (LML: -4946.284)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the multiplicative strength of the periodic kernel (PER) with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), which can capture varying smoothness, while also incorporating the interaction of the periodic kernel with itself to leverage its periodicity. By mixing these components, the kernel aims to enhance flexibility and capture any potential periodic structures more effectively than either parent alone, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ + SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior from the second parent ((PER * PER)) with the flexibility of the rational quadratic and squared exponential components from the first parent ((RQ + SE)). The addition of these two components aims to leverage the periodic structure while maintaining the adaptability of the RQ and SE kernels, potentially improving the fit and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER)) (LML: -4946.303)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + ((PER * PER) * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic behavior captured by the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding the product of (PER * RQ) to the expression ((PER * PER) * RQ), we aim to leverage the periodicity in the data while maintaining the ability to capture varying degrees of smoothness and scale provided by the RQ kernel. This hybrid approach may result in a better fit to the data, thereby improving the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By introducing the SE kernel, which is known for its smoothness and ability to model continuous functions, we can enhance the flexibility of the kernel. The combination of SE with the product of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels allows for capturing both periodic behavior and varying length scales in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML compared to the original kernel.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel, which is effective for modeling smooth variations in the data, with a combination of the periodic structures from the (PER * RQ) term and the periodicity captured by the (PER * PER) term. By adding the SE kernel, we aim to improve the overall smoothness and flexibility of the model while leveraging the periodic patterns captured by the other components. This combination should result in a more versatile kernel that could potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood by effectively capturing both smooth variations and periodic behaviors in the data.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication to apply to the sum of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels, we can capture both periodic behavior and varying smoothness more effectively. This approach allows the model to adapt better to complex data patterns, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The combination may enhance the model's flexibility without losing the smoothness provided by the squared exponential kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already has a higher LML score compared to Parent 2. By combining the Squared Exponential kernel with the product of the Periodic and Rational Quadratic kernels, we aim to capture both smoothness (from SE) and periodic variations (from PER) while also allowing for varying length scales (from RQ). This combination is likely to improve the model's flexibility and thus achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-2137.716
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: By using multiplication between the SE and PER kernels, we can enhance the model's capacity to capture smooth variations along with periodic patterns. Adding the RQ kernel allows for additional flexibility in fitting the data, particularly in regions where the variance may change. This combination should help in achieving a better fit and potentially higher LML than the current kernel.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: The proposed kernel reuses the structure of Parent 1, which achieved a better log marginal likelihood (LML) score compared to Parent 2. By retaining the additive combination of the Squared Exponential kernel with the product of the Periodic and Rational Quadratic kernels, we leverage the smoothness of SE while incorporating the periodicity and varying length scales from the PER and RQ combination. This combination is likely to capture both the local smooth variations and periodic patterns present in the data, potentially leading to an improved LML.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-2137.716
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By multiplying the SE and RQ kernels, we can capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the varying length scales of the RQ kernel, potentially allowing for better fitting of non-stationary data. Adding the PER kernel afterward can help to incorporate periodicity in the data without overwhelming the influence of the combined SE and RQ structure. This structure may provide a better balance and flexibility, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already has a relatively higher LML of -2137.716 compared to Parent 2. By maintaining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel, we ensure smoothness and flexibility in capturing variations in the data, while the combination of the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels can account for both periodic patterns and varying smoothness. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of the SE kernel for general trend capture along with the ability of the PER * RQ combination to model complex periodic behaviors effectively. Given that Parent 1 has a better LML score, this formulation is expected to retain its advantages while potentially improving upon the overall fit.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression retains the structure of Parent 1, which already demonstrated a more favorable LML score compared to Parent 2. By including the SE kernel, we enhance the model's flexibility to capture smooth variations in the data. The combination of the periodic kernel (PER) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) allows for capturing periodic behavior and varying length scales, respectively. This balanced approach aims to leverage the strengths of both periodicity and smoothness while avoiding the over-complexity observed in Parent 2, potentially leading to an improved LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already shows a better LML score than Parent 2. By combining the squared exponential kernel (SE) with the product of periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ), we leverage the smoothness of SE while still capturing periodic behavior and varying length scales from the PER and RQ combination. This approach may enhance the flexibility of the model to fit the data better than the purely periodic approach in Parent 2, potentially leading to a higher LML.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-2137.716
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: By switching to a multiplication of the SE kernel with the sum of the PER and RQ kernels, we can allow for greater flexibility in capturing both periodic and long-range variations in the data. The SE kernel will provide a smooth function while accommodating the periodic behavior and the varying length scales introduced by the RQ kernel, potentially improving the fit and thus increasing the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the SE kernel, which is known for its smoothness and flexibility, with the periodic structure provided by the (PER * RQ) component from Parent 1. The addition of the SE kernel can help to capture the overall trends in the data more effectively, while the periodic part allows for modeling repeated patterns. Given that Parent 1 already had a relatively better LML score compared to Parent 2, this combination aims to leverage the strengths of both smoothness and periodicity, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already shows a higher LML (-2137.716) compared to Parent 2. By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the interaction of the Periodic (PER) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, we leverage the smoothness of SE while still capturing the periodic behavior and varying length scales from the other two kernels.

Analysis: The proposed kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already has a higher LML score compared to Parent 2. By incorporating the squared exponential (SE) kernel, we enhance the ability to model smooth variations in the data, while the product of the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels captures periodic patterns with varying smoothness. This combination leverages the strengths of both periodicity and smoothness, potentially leading to an even better fit and higher LML than either parent.

Analysis: By switching the multiplication between the periodic kernel (PER) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) to addition, we allow for the combination of smoothness from SE and the flexibility of RQ, while still capturing periodic behavior separately. This may enhance the model's ability to capture underlying patterns, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel expression retains the successful structure of Parent 1, which already has a higher LML compared to Parent 2. By incorporating the SE kernel, we introduce smoothness to the model, which is beneficial for capturing general trends in the data. The multiplication of PER and RQ helps to model periodic behavior with varying scales, while the addition of SE ensures that we can effectively capture both local and global patterns in the data.

Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already has a favorable LML score of -2137.716. By incorporating the Squared Exponential kernel (SE), we introduce smoothness to the model, which is beneficial for capturing underlying trends. The periodic component (PER) combined with the rational quadratic (RQ) allows flexibility in modeling periodic patterns with varying length scales. Since Parent 1 has a better LML than Parent 2, maintaining this combination while leveraging the SE kernel may help in achieving an even higher LML by balancing smoothness and periodicity.

Analysis: The first parent kernel already shows a relatively higher LML score compared to the second parent, indicating it captures the data structure better. By retaining the SE kernel in combination with the periodic and rational quadratic components of the second parent, we can leverage the smoothness from SE while also incorporating the periodic and varying scale properties from PER and RQ. Retaining the structure of the first parent while introducing multiplicative interactions could potentially enhance the model's flexibility, aiming for a higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel expression is directly taken from Parent 1, which already has a higher LML score compared to Parent 2. By maintaining the addition of the SE kernel, we leverage its smoothness and flexibility while still incorporating the periodicity and scale variations provided by the combination of PER and RQ. This combination is likely to capture both the smooth trends and seasonal variations in the data, potentially leading to an even better fit and an increased LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: By removing the periodic component (PER) and focusing on the combination of the squared exponential (SE) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels, we can capture both smoothness and varying length scales more effectively. The product (SE * RQ) allows for flexible modeling of the underlying function, which may lead to a better fit to the observed data and potentially a higher LML score.

    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel takes the successful structure of Parent 1, which already has a relatively higher LML score compared to Parent 2. By maintaining the SE component, which contributes smoothness and flexibility, and combining it with the periodic and rational quadratic aspects of the data through the (PER * RQ) term, we aim to capture both smooth variations and periodic behavior.

By keeping the structure of the first parent, we leverage the combination of the squared exponential's smoothness, the periodic nature of the PER kernel, and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This combination captures both local smoothness and periodic patterns in the data, which might be beneficial for achieving a higher LML.

Analysis: The first parent kernel already demonstrates a higher LML score compared to the second parent kernel. To capitalize on this strength, I propose retaining the structure of the first parent while considering the interaction with the Rational Quadratic kernel. By keeping the form (SE + (PER * RQ)), we maintain the contribution of both periodicity and the varying length scales from the Rational Quadratic kernel, which could potentially enhance the fit to the observed data without the complexity introduced in the second parent.

Analysis: The first parent kernel already shows a promising LML score of -2137.716, indicating a good fit to the data. By retaining the combination of SE and the interaction between PER and RQ, we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while incorporating periodicity and variations captured by PER and RQ. This kernel structure allows for flexibility and captures both local and periodic patterns effectively.

  Parent 2: ((SE + PER) * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -2424.020)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * (RQ + PER)) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parents by retaining the successful structure of Parent 2, which includes the interaction between the periodic and rational quadratic components, while also incorporating the interaction between the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels from Parent 1. This addition may capture both smooth and periodic patterns in the data more effectively, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((SE + PER) * (RQ + PER)) + (SE * RQ)... LML=-4946.310
  Kernel depth: 4

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((SE + PER) * (RQ + PER)) (LML: -2424.020)
  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying (SE + PER) with RQ, we allow for a model that captures both smooth variations and periodic patterns, potentially leading to a better fit to the data and improving the LML beyond that of either parent. This structure leverages the strengths of both parent kernels while aiming to mitigate their weaknesses.
