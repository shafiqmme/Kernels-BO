Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  Parent 2: ((PER + PER) + RQ) (LML: -4946.284)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying PER with RQ, we introduce a kernel that can capture both periodic and varying scale behavior, while the addition of (PER * PER) retains the purely periodic influence. This approach leverages the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially improving the LML by allowing for better fitting to data that exhibits both periodicity and varying smoothness.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ + SE) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the first parent (which utilizes RQ and SE) and incorporates periodicity from the second parent (PER). By multiplying the base kernel that captures both smoothness and varying scales (RQ + SE) with the periodic kernel (PER), we aim to capture complex behaviors that may exhibit both smooth variations and periodic patterns. This combination could potentially improve the LML by accommodating diverse structures in the data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ + SE) * (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the strengths of both parent kernels by taking the original structure of Parent 1, which incorporates the flexibility of RQ and SE, and multiplying it with the squared periodic kernel from Parent 2. This approach aims to capture both the smoothness characteristics of the RQ and SE kernels while leveraging the periodic nature of PER, potentially allowing for better fitting to periodic data with varying smoothness. The multiplication of the periodic kernel may enhance the model's ability to capture complex periodic patterns.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((RQ + SE) * PER) (LML: -3142.891)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: The current kernel combines the rational quadratic and squared exponential with periodicity, which may introduce unnecessary complexity without improving the fit. By simplifying the structure to (SE + (RQ * PER)), we retain the beneficial properties of the periodic kernel while making use of the rational quadratic to model varying smoothness. This modification aims to enhance flexibility and fit to the observed data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the flexibility of both SE and RQ. The term (SE * PER) captures variations that can occur within periodic structures, while (RQ * PER) allows for multiple scale variations within the periodic context. This combination aims to leverage both the smoothness of the squared exponential and the ability of the rational quadratic to model varying smoothness, potentially leading to an improved fit and higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels before applying the periodic (PER) component. By using addition of SE and RQ, we leverage the smoothness and flexibility of both kernels, which improves modeling of the underlying function. The multiplication with PER captures periodic patterns in the data effectively, potentially enhancing the fit compared to both parent kernels. This structure aims to maximize the log marginal likelihood by integrating the strengths of the SE and RQ kernels while retaining the periodic nature offered by PER.

  Parent 2: ((RQ + SE) * PER) (LML: -3142.891)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parental kernels by using the SE and RQ kernels together in a sum, which can capture both smooth variations (SE) and varying lengths of correlations (RQ), while still modulating this combined effect with the periodic structure from the PER kernel. This structure allows for the flexibility of both smoothness and periodicity, potentially improving the fit to the data compared to either parent kernel alone.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER)... LML=-2224.904

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (RQ * PER)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By multiplying the SE and RQ kernels, we can capture both smoothness and variations in the data effectively, as the RQ kernel allows for varying lengths in the input space. Adding the PER kernel can help model any periodic behavior present in the data. This combination may improve the overall fit, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER) 
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of PER with the smoothness of SE and RQ. By using multiplication with PER, we allow for the periodic structure to modulate the base kernels, potentially capturing the underlying periodic patterns in the data while still maintaining the flexibility of the SE and RQ. This composite approach aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, which may lead to improved fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)... LML=-4946.309
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (RQ * PER)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER)
Analysis: The current kernel includes a combination of kernels that may overly complicate the model, potentially leading to overfitting. By simplifying the kernel to just the product of the Squared Exponential (SE) and the Periodic (PER) kernels, we can potentially capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodicity of the PER kernel without introducing noise from the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. This could lead to a better fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * PER)) * PER)
Analysis: By combining the first parent kernel, which integrates the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ and periodicity of the PER, and multiplying it by the PER kernel, we enhance the periodic aspects of the first parent. This may allow the model to capture both the smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + (RQ * PER)) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 1 with the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By multiplying the combination of SE and RQ * PER with PER, we allow the model to capture both the smoothness from SE and the variation from RQ while maintaining periodicity. This hybrid approach aims to enrich the model's expressiveness, potentially improving the LML by accommodating both smooth and oscillatory patterns in the data.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which has already demonstrated a better LML score compared to Parent 2. By keeping the combination of the SE kernel and the product of RQ and PER, we aim to leverage the smoothness of SE and the ability of RQ and PER to model varying patterns in the data. This combination has shown promise in capturing complex relationships in the observed data, potentially leading to improved LML.

  Parent 2: ((RQ + SE) * PER) (LML: -3142.891)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * PER) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the periodic aspect of the PER kernel while allowing for the smoothness of the SE and RQ kernels to influence the fit independently. By using multiplication with PER, this formulation captures periodic patterns while ensuring that both the SE and RQ kernels contribute to the overall structure, potentially improving the LML by enhancing flexibility in different data regions.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (RQ * PER)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (SE * PER))
Analysis: By replacing the RQ kernel with an additional SE kernel and using multiplication with the PER kernel, this expression captures both smoothness and periodicity more effectively. The SE kernel provides a strong basis for modeling smooth trends, and its interaction with the PER kernel can enhance the model's capability to fit periodic structures in the data. This modification is likely to improve the LML by better accommodating the underlying data patterns.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel maintains the structure of Parent 1, which already exhibited a better LML than Parent 2. By incorporating the RQ kernel alongside the periodic component PER, it captures the smoothness and variability characteristics effectively, while still allowing for periodic behavior. The addition of SE provides a strong foundation for the overall smoothness of the function, aiming to improve the LML further by combining the effective features of both parents.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression retains the successful combination seen in Parent 1, which already has a relatively high LML score. By including the RQ kernel in a multiplicative relationship with the PER kernel, we capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodic nature of the PER kernel, while allowing for the flexibility introduced by the RQ kernel. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially improving the fit to the data and achieving a higher LML than either parent.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which has a higher LML value than Parent 2. By keeping the combination of the RQ and PER within the additive term with SE, we leverage the smoothness of SE while allowing for periodic variations influenced by PER and the flexibility of RQ. This proposed kernel aims to maintain the favorable characteristics of Parent 1 while potentially improving on the LML by ensuring that the interactions between periodic and rational quadratic behaviors are preserved.

Analysis: By using multiplication between the SE and PER kernels, we can capture both smoothness and periodicity in the data jointly, which often leads to better fit in cases where the data exhibits both characteristics. Additionally, adding the RQ kernel allows for capturing varying smoothness, which can further enhance the flexibility of the model. This combination may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood than the original kernel.

Analysis: By combining the first parent kernel, which has a higher LML, with a portion of the second parent (SE * PER), this new expression retains the periodic structure from PER while incorporating the flexibility of both SE and RQ. The addition of (SE * PER) aims to capture additional variations in the data that may not be fully represented by the first parent alone, potentially leading to an improved overall fit and higher LML.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the flexibility of both the SE and RQ kernels. By adding the term (SE * RQ), we introduce a component that captures the varying length scales (from RQ) along with the smoothness (from SE) while still leveraging the periodic structure provided by PER.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior from the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel and the smoothness of the SE kernel. By adding an independent SE kernel to the combination, it allows for capturing overall trends in the data while still maintaining the periodic and rational quadratic effects present in the original kernels. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML.

Analysis: By replacing the second occurrence of PER in the original kernel with RQ, we allow for more flexibility in modeling data that may exhibit both periodic and varying smoothness characteristics. The interaction between the SE and RQ kernels can help capture complex patterns that the original kernel might be missing, potentially improving the fit and resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by incorporating the periodic structure of PER while also leveraging the smoothness of the SE kernel. By adding SE to PER, we allow for the flexibility to capture variations that may not fit a purely periodic pattern, potentially improving the model's fit to the data. The multiplication with (SE + RQ) retains the benefits of both the rational quadratic and squared exponential kernels, which can help in modeling non-stationary behavior effectively.

Analysis: By simplifying the original kernel and focusing on the interaction between the periodicity of PER and the smoothness of SE and RQ, we can potentially enhance the kernel's ability to capture patterns in the data. The multiplication of RQ and PER may introduce additional flexibility to model variations that are both smooth and periodic, which might improve the LML.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the SE and RQ kernels. By adding the interaction of the SE and PER terms, we can capture the underlying trends while also accounting for periodicities in the data. The structure retains the complexity of both parent kernels, potentially leading to improved fit and higher LML by leveraging the strengths of each component.

Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of Parent 1, which includes the interaction of the RQ and PER kernels, with the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By multiplying this combination with PER, we aim to enhance the periodic contributions while retaining the flexibility introduced by the RQ kernel. This should help in capturing both smoothness and periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By focusing on the interaction between the periodic kernel (PER) and the other kernels, we can potentially capture more complex patterns in the data. The original kernel structure included a combination of addition and multiplication that may have diluted the influence of the PER kernel. By multiplying PER with both SE and RQ separately, we allow each kernel to contribute to the periodic structure more effectively, which may result in a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic nature of the PER kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding SE and PER, we capture both the general trend and periodic variations in the data. Multiplying by RQ allows us to introduce additional flexibility in modeling varying length scales, which could improve the fit to the data and potentially yield a higher LML than the parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel expression retains the structure of Parent 2, which has a significantly higher LML than Parent 1. By adding the squared exponential (SE) kernel to the product of the rational quadratic (RQ) and periodic (PER) kernels, we can potentially capture both smoothness from the SE kernel and the varying periodic behavior modulated by RQ and PER. This combination aims to exploit the strengths of both parent kernels, hopefully achieving an even better fit to the observed data and thus maximizing the LML further.

This modification also reduces complexity by eliminating the redundant addition of the SE * PER term, which could help improve the LML by simplifying the kernel structure while retaining essential features. The combination of SE and RQ with PER may provide a better fit to the underlying data distribution.

    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: The second parent kernel, (SE + (RQ * PER)), already demonstrates a significantly higher LML than the first parent. By keeping this structure, we maintain the beneficial combination of the Squared Exponential kernel's smoothness with the Rational Quadratic's flexibility and the periodic nature of the PER kernel. This kernel effectively captures varying patterns in the data. To further explore potential improvements, we could also consider slight modifications like adding SE or PER separately, but the current structure has already shown a strong fit.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior from the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE and RQ kernels. By adding (SE * RQ), we introduce a level of flexibility that can capture varying lengths of correlations in the data, while still retaining the periodic structure from PER. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood by accommodating various aspects of the data's underlying structure.

Analysis: This kernel expression combines the structure of both parent kernels by incorporating the existing interaction between the parent kernels and enhancing it with the RQ kernel's flexibility. By multiplying the entire expression by RQ, we introduce additional variation and complexity that could better model the data's behavior, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER) + (SE * (RQ + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of both parents by maintaining the interaction between the periodic component (PER) and the squared exponential (SE) while incorporating the rational quadratic (RQ) to capture varying smoothness. By keeping the addition of (SE * PER), we leverage the benefits of combining the periodic behavior with the smoothness of SE, while also allowing for RQ to adjust the overall smoothness dynamically. This formulation aims to balance the periodicity with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, potentially improving the LML by harnessing the strengths of both parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)
Analysis: By simplifying the kernel and focusing on the periodic component (PER), we can enhance the fit for periodic patterns in the data. The first term (SE * PER) captures smooth variations modulated by periodicity, while the second term (RQ * PER) allows for varying smoothness in periodic behavior. This combination could potentially achieve a higher log marginal likelihood by leveraging the strengths of both the SE and RQ kernels in capturing different aspects of the data's structure.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER) + SE
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the SE and RQ kernels. By including SE separately, it allows for capturing the smoothness and local variations in the data while still maintaining the periodic structure through the multiplication with PER. This formulation aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while potentially enhancing the fit to the observed data, which may lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By combining the SE and RQ kernels multiplicatively, we can capture both local and global variations in the data more effectively. The addition of the PER kernel allows us to model periodic patterns without overly complicating the structure. This modification simplifies the kernel while potentially improving its ability to fit the data by focusing on the significant interactions between the base kernels. This change could lead to an increase in the log marginal likelihood (LML) by leveraging the strengths of each kernel more effectively.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the strengths of both SE and RQ kernels. By adding (RQ + PER) to the SE term in the second part of the kernel, we enhance the flexibility in capturing both smooth trends from SE and varying periodic patterns from PER while still leveraging the RQ's ability to model long-range correlations.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (((SE + RQ) * PER) + (SE * PER)) * (SE + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the existing strengths of both Parent 1 and Parent 2 by taking the entire structure of one of the parents and multiplying it by the combined kernel of SE and RQ. The multiplication allows for an increased flexibility in modeling the interactions between the periodic nature of PER and the smoothness from SE and RQ, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data and thereby improving the log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: This new kernel combines the existing parent kernels by taking the best components from both. By multiplying the entire structure of Parent 2 with the RQ kernel, it introduces additional flexibility to capture non-stationary behaviors and varying lengths of scale given by RQ. This approach aims to leverage the benefits of both the periodicity from PER and the smoothness properties of SE and RQ, potentially leading to an improved fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By focusing on the interaction between the periodicity of the PER kernel and the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also allowing for the flexibility of the RQ kernel to capture varying length scales, this new kernel can better model complex patterns in the data. The removal of the additive combination of SE and RQ allows for a more direct multiplicative relationship, which can help in capturing interactions more effectively, potentially leading to an improved LML.

    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This expression combines the benefits of the relationship between the SE and RQ kernels while preserving the periodic nature of the PER kernel. It allows for the smoothness of SE and the flexibility of RQ to model varying scales, all modulated by the periodic pattern of PER. Given that this configuration already showed a decent fit with an LML score of -2224.904, it is likely to maintain strong performance while potentially allowing for improved modeling of the data's underlying structure.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: The proposed kernel expression is identical to Parent 1, which already has a higher LML than Parent 2. However, to explore a different combination that may leverage the strengths of both parents, I suggest using (SE * PER) + ((SE + RQ) * PER) to emphasize the periodic nature while maintaining the smoothness of the SE and RQ kernels. This combination retains the periodic structure while allowing for variations introduced by the rational quadratic kernel, potentially leading to a better fit for the data. The goal is to capture both the smoothness of the SE and RQ kernels and the periodicity of the PER kernel effectively. The new expression could therefore be: (SE * PER) + ((SE + RQ) * PER), which may yield a higher LML by balancing the contributions from both parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of PER with the flexibility of RQ and the smoothness of SE. By adding the term (RQ + PER) to the SE component, we leverage the strengths of both parents, potentially capturing both periodic and smooth variations in the data. The structure aims to enhance the model’s ability to fit complex patterns while still retaining the foundational benefits of the base kernels, which may lead to an improved log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the strengths of both the SE and RQ kernels. By adding the term (RQ * PER), we allow for variations that are both periodic and influenced by the rational quadratic properties, which can capture more complex patterns in the data. The inclusion of the SE term provides a smooth component that can help in fitting the overall trend, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood by leveraging the strengths of each base kernel effectively.

Analysis: This kernel expression is the same as Parent 1, which already has a relatively high LML of -1868.027. It effectively combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel and the periodic nature of the PER kernel. Since this expression has shown a better fit in terms of LML, retaining it while considering adjustments can help explore its strengths further. To propose a new kernel, we might also consider variations such as ((SE + (RQ * PER)) * PER) to explore interactions more deeply while keeping the periodic nature.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((SE + RQ) * PER) + (SE * PER) (LML: -1868.027)
  Parent 2: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -2224.904)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic component from Parent 1 with the rational quadratic component from Parent 2, leveraging the strengths of both kernels. By introducing the interaction term (SE * RQ), we allow the model to capture variations in the data that may arise from both smoothness (via SE) and the ability to model varying length scales (via RQ). This combination aims to enhance flexibility and potentially yield a higher LML by better fitting the observed data structure.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER) + (SE * RQ)... LML=-4946.306
