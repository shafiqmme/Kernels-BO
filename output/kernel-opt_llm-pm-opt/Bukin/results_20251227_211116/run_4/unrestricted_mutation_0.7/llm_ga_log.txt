Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  Parent 2: ((PER + PER) + RQ) (LML: -4946.284)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic structure of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, allowing it to capture both periodic patterns and varying length scales. The addition of the term (PER * PER) retains the periodicity while the (PER * RQ) term introduces variability, which can help improve the fit to the data and potentially yield a higher LML than both parent kernels.

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ + SE) * (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strength of the rational quadratic (RQ) and squared exponential (SE) from Parent 1 with the periodic kernel (PER) from Parent 2. By multiplying the combined RQ and SE kernel with the squared periodic kernel, we aim to capture both smooth variations (from RQ and SE) and periodic trends (from PER). This approach leverages the flexibility of RQ and SE for capturing local behavior while also modeling periodicity effectively, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) than either parent.
  Result: ((RQ + SE) * (PER * PER))... LML=-4946.303
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By introducing the SE kernel, which captures smoothness and local variations, we can enhance the fit to the data. The addition of SE allows for better modeling of non-periodic trends, while still retaining the periodic behavior through the PER * RQ component. This modification should provide a more flexible kernel structure, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: The first parent kernel already demonstrates a reasonable fit with an LML of -2137.716. By maintaining the structure of the first parent while potentially incorporating the periodic behavior from the second parent, we can explore the interaction of the SE kernel with the periodicity introduced by (PER * RQ). This combination retains the smoothness of SE while allowing for the capture of more complex patterns through the periodic component, which may help improve the model's LML.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: By changing the structure to multiply the SE and RQ kernels together, we can capture both smoothness and varying length-scales, which might help model the underlying function more effectively. Adding the PER kernel afterward allows us to integrate periodicity, potentially improving the fit to periodic patterns in the data. This modification can potentially enhance the flexibility of the model and lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + ((PER * RQ) * (PER * RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel, which is effective for smooth functions, with a product of periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels, which can capture periodic patterns with varying length scales. By introducing the square of the periodic part ((PER * RQ) * (PER * RQ)), we aim to enhance the expressiveness of the kernel in capturing complex periodic behavior while maintaining the smoothness from the SE kernel. This combination leverages the strengths of both parent kernels and may improve the fit to the observed data, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: By changing the structure to multiply the SE kernel with the sum of the PER and RQ kernels, we allow for a more flexible model that can capture both periodic and rational quadratic behaviors while maintaining smoothness from the SE kernel. This combination could potentially improve the fit to the data and yield a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) score by leveraging the strengths of the periodic and rational quadratic components more effectively.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: The first parent kernel already showed a relatively higher LML score compared to the second parent. By retaining the combination of the SE kernel, which is effective for smoothness, with the periodic structure from the PER kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel, we maintain a balance of properties that allows for both smooth variations and periodic behavior. This new kernel expression aims to leverage the strengths of the first parent's structure while minimizing the complexity introduced by the second parent's excessive periodicity. The expectation is that this combination will yield a higher LML than both parent kernels.
  Result: (SE + (PER * RQ))... LML=-2137.716
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: By focusing on the interaction between the squared exponential kernel (SE) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ), we can capture both smoothness and varying length scales more effectively. The multiplication of these kernels allows for more complex relationships in the data while eliminating the periodic component that may not be necessary for the current dataset, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) with the periodicity of the Periodic (PER) kernel, allowing for a flexible model that can capture both continuous variations and periodic patterns. By multiplying this combination with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, we introduce a scale mixture that can handle varying levels of smoothness, potentially leading to a better fit than either parent kernel. This structure aims to leverage the strengths of smoothness and periodicity while accommodating non-stationary effects, which may result in a higher log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication to involve a sum of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels, we allow for more flexibility in capturing variations in the data. The periodic kernel can model cyclical patterns, while the rational quadratic kernel can account for varying degrees of smoothness. This combination may better fit the observed data compared to the original kernel structure, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * (RQ + SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive properties of both parent kernels while introducing a secondary interaction through the addition of SE to RQ. By leveraging the strengths of the SE and PER components from Parent 1 and incorporating RQ in a way that enhances the overall flexibility of the model, we aim to capture more complex patterns in the data. This could potentially lead to a higher log marginal likelihood by accommodating both smooth variations (via SE) and periodic structures (via PER) while still benefiting from the adaptability of the RQ kernel.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: By multiplying the SE kernel with the PER kernel, we can capture both smooth variations and periodic structures more effectively. Adding the RQ kernel allows us to model variations with different length scales, which can help improve flexibility and lead to a better fit for the data. This combination should enhance the overall expressiveness of the kernel, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE kernel with the RQ kernel, which captures the smoothness and flexibility of the data, while also adding the periodicity through the PER kernel separately. By using addition, we maintain the periodic component's influence without diluting the interaction between the SE and RQ kernels, potentially improving the overall fit and thus the log marginal likelihood based on the strengths of both parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the RQ kernel's ability to model varying length scales with the SE kernel's smoothness, while also incorporating the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By adding the product of PER and RQ to the product of SE and RQ, we aim to capture both smooth variations and periodic behaviors, potentially leading to a better fit to the observed data and an increase in the log marginal likelihood.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: By focusing on the multiplicative combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels, we leverage the smoothness properties of both kernels. The SE kernel is known for its ability to model smooth functions, while the RQ kernel can capture varying degrees of smoothness due to its additional flexibility. Removing the periodic component allows for a better fit when the data does not exhibit strong periodicity, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((SE + PER) * (RQ + SE)) (LML: -4841.240)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the squared exponential (SE) and rational quadratic (RQ) through multiplication, which allows for capturing local variations and smoothness, while also incorporating the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By adding the periodic component, we can model periodic behaviors on top of the smooth variations provided by SE and RQ, potentially improving the fit to the observed data and leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: By using multiplication between the SE and PER kernels, we capture both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodic structure of the PER kernel effectively. This combination allows for a more flexible model that can adapt to periodic trends while maintaining overall smoothness. Adding the RQ kernel afterward can model varying degrees of smoothness and capture additional noise, potentially improving the LML score compared to the current kernel structure.

  Parent 2: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -3353.499)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By retaining the structure of Parent 1, which already has a better LML score than Parent 2, I propose the same kernel as Parent 1. This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE with the periodicity introduced by PER and the flexibility of RQ, potentially capturing complex patterns in the data. Given that it already has a higher LML score, it is reasonable to expect that this combination may still be optimal or yield competitive results.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By switching the order of the operations and modifying the interaction between the kernels, this expression allows the rational quadratic kernel's ability to capture varying smoothness to interact multiplicatively with the squared exponential kernel, while still adding the periodic kernel. This could help in capturing both the smooth and periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression is identical to Parent 1, which already has the highest LML among the provided options. By maintaining the same structure, it combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic nature of the PER kernel, enhanced by the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This combination captures both local and global patterns in the data effectively, aiming to leverage its prior performance. It is prudent to retain this structure as it has shown better fit compared to the other candidate.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: The proposed kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already shows a better LML score compared to Parent 2. By combining the Squared Exponential kernel with the product of the Periodic and Rational Quadratic kernels, we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while incorporating the periodic and varying length scale characteristics offered by the PER and RQ kernels. This combination aims to capture more complex data patterns, potentially leading to improved LML on the observed data.

Analysis: By simplifying the kernel to (SE + RQ), we reduce the complexity introduced by the periodic component (PER). The periodic kernel might not be fitting the data well, leading to a lower LML. The combination of SE (which captures smooth variations) and RQ (which allows for varying smoothness) can better model the underlying function, potentially leading to a higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which has a higher LML score compared to Parent 2. By keeping the addition of the SE kernel along with the interaction of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels (PER * RQ), we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while still accommodating any periodic behavior modulated by RQ. The aim is to combine the benefits of both parent kernels while keeping the overall complexity manageable, thus potentially improving the LML score further.

Analysis: This kernel combines the effects of the SE and PER kernels while also incorporating the RQ kernel with an additional SE component. By adding SE to RQ, we can introduce more flexibility in capturing smooth variations along with periodic patterns, potentially improving the fit to the data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood. The multiplication with the sum of (SE + PER) also allows for interactions between the periodic and smooth components, which may enhance the model's expressive power.

Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which already has a better LML score compared to Parent 2. By maintaining the addition of the SE kernel with the product of PER and RQ, we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while incorporating the periodic and rational aspects from PER and RQ.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the multiplicative interaction of the SE and RQ kernels, which captures smoothness and varying length scales, with the periodic structure introduced by the PER kernel, scaled by RQ to adjust for varying amplitudes. This new expression aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels by allowing for both local smooth features (from SE) and periodic variations (from PER), while maintaining flexibility through the RQ kernel.

Adding the Periodic (PER) kernel ensures that any periodic patterns in the data are retained. By focusing on the interaction between SE and RQ while preserving the periodicity, this kernel aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to potentially achieve a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

Analysis: By combining the periodic kernel (PER) with the squared exponential (SE) and adding it to the rational quadratic (RQ) along with another SE, we leverage the strengths of both parent kernels. The periodic component captures any oscillatory behavior in the data, while the SE provides smoothness. Adding the RQ allows for varying lengths scales, which can help in fitting data with different characteristics. This kernel keeps the successful structure of Parent 1 while attempting to enhance the LML by including the additional SE term from Parent 1.

Crossover 1:

  Parent 2: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -3353.499)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the two parent kernels by allowing the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) to model varying smoothness combined with the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By using multiplication between SE and RQ, we can capture localized variations in the data, while the addition of the PER kernel accounts for periodic patterns that might be present. This hybrid approach aims to balance both smoothness and periodicity, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.

Analysis: By removing the periodic component, we focus on the smoother variations captured by the RQ kernel, combined with the flexibility of the SE kernel. This combination can potentially capture a wider range of patterns in the data without the added complexity of the periodicity, which may not be necessary and could be leading to overfitting. This simplification may improve the LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior from the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying (SE + PER) with RQ, we aim to retain the additive structure of both parent kernels while leveraging the ability of RQ to model varying scales of correlation. This approach is expected to fit data with both smooth trends and periodic variations better than each parent kernel alone, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This kernel retains the successful combination from Parent 1, which already showed a better LML score compared to Parent 2. By keeping the interaction of the periodic and rational quadratic components while maintaining the squared exponential base, we leverage the strengths of both periodicity and smoothness in the data. This combination is likely to better capture varying patterns in the observed data, potentially leading to an improved fit and a higher LML.

Analysis: The first parent kernel already includes a combination of the squared exponential and periodic components modulated by the rational quadratic kernel. This structure captures both smoothness (via SE) and periodic behavior (via PER) while also allowing for varying length scales (via RQ). Given that it has a higher LML score than the second parent, I propose to retain this configuration as it already demonstrates better fitting characteristics. This kernel combines the effective traits of smoothness and periodicity, which may generalize well on the observed data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) component from both parent kernels to leverage its capability for smoothness and local variations. The term (SE * RQ) captures varying smoothness levels, while (PER * RQ) introduces periodicity with adjustable length scales from the Rational Quadratic. By including all these components, the proposed kernel aims to capture both the smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data more effectively, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic kernel (RQ) with the smoothness of the Squared Exponential kernel (SE) and maintains the periodic behavior introduced by the Periodic kernel (PER). By directly integrating PER into the combination, we preserve the potential for capturing periodic trends while leveraging the interaction between SE and RQ, which can help in fitting the data more effectively.

Analysis: By changing the order of operations and using multiplication with the periodic kernel (PER), this expression allows for capturing both the smoothness of the squared exponential (SE) and the long-range variations of the rational quadratic (RQ) while modulating these effects by the periodic nature of PER. This could potentially increase the LML by better modeling the underlying patterns in the data.

  Parent 2: ((SE * RQ) + (SE * PER)) (LML: -2239.228)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * (PER + RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the sum of the Periodic (PER) and Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernels. The rationale behind this combination is to capture both the smoothness from the SE kernel and the variability from the periodic nature of the PER kernel alongside the adaptability of the RQ kernel. By multiplying SE with the sum of PER and RQ, this kernel aims to exploit the strengths of all components, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood than both parent kernels.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ
Analysis: By multiplying the SE and PER kernels, we combine the smoothness of the SE with the periodic behavior of the PER, capturing both local variations and periodic patterns more effectively. Adding the RQ kernel allows for additional flexibility in modeling variations at different scales, potentially improving the fit to the data and thus increasing the log marginal likelihood. This modified kernel aims to leverage the strengths of each component more synergistically.

  Parent 2: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -2224.904)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the structure of both parent kernels by leveraging the capabilities of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel to modulate the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Periodic (PER) components. The addition of (RQ * PER) allows for capturing both periodicity and varying smoothness, potentially improving the model's flexibility and fit to the data compared to the individual contributions of the parent kernels. This new combination aims to enhance the overall LML by integrating the strengths of RQ in managing varying length scales and the periodic nature of the data.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + PER)
Analysis: By changing the structure to multiply SE and RQ first and then adding PER, we allow for the interaction between length-scale and periodicity to better model the data. This can help capture both smooth variations (from SE and RQ) and periodic patterns (from PER) more effectively, potentially leading to a higher LML score.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel, while also incorporating the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding SE and PER, we capture both short-term variations and long-term periodic patterns, and then multiplying by RQ provides a better fit for data with varying smoothness, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: By simplifying the kernel to just the combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) and Periodic (PER) kernels, we remove the complexity of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, which may not be contributing positively to the LML. The SE kernel captures smooth variations, while the PER kernel accounts for periodic behavior, potentially leading to a better fit for data with seasonal patterns. This modification retains the desirable properties of both base kernels while reducing the complexity that could hinder the optimization of the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * RQ)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel with both the Squared Exponential (SE) and Periodic (PER) kernels. By including (SE * RQ), we retain the smoothness properties of both kernels, while incorporating (PER * RQ) captures periodic variations with a varying length scale, introducing more flexibility in modeling complex data. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parents, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) than either parent alone.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: By multiplying the current kernel with the Rational Quadratic kernel (RQ), we can capture a wider range of variability and smoothness in the data. The RQ kernel’s ability to model varying length scales could help in fitting the data better, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the current kernel. The combination of the periodic and the squared exponential components with RQ may provide a more flexible model that can adapt to the observed data patterns.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the first parent by leveraging the smoothness of the SE and RQ kernels while also incorporating the periodicity from the PER kernel. By multiplying PER with RQ, we allow for periodic fluctuations while maintaining the overall smoothness of the signal, potentially capturing more underlying structure in the data. This combination aims to balance the contributions of both kernels to improve the log marginal likelihood.
