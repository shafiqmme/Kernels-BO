Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  Parent 2: ((PER + PER) + RQ) (LML: -4946.284)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel scaled by the RQ kernel, which captures varying smoothness across the input space. By adding the RQ kernel, we aim to leverage its ability to model non-stationarity, potentially improving the fit over the parent kernels while staying within the depth limit. This combination should allow for more flexibility in capturing patterns in the data that the individual kernels may miss.
  Result: ((PER * RQ) + RQ)... LML=-4946.311

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ + SE) * PER)
Analysis: This new kernel combines the smoothness of the RQ and SE kernels with the periodicity of the PER kernel. By using addition to blend RQ and SE, we capture both the long-range smoothness and local variations, while multiplying by the PER kernel introduces periodic behavior. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially resulting in improved flexibility and fit, thereby increasing the log marginal likelihood.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -4898.299)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, and it is modulated by the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By adding SE and RQ, we introduce more variability in the fit, potentially capturing complex patterns in the data, while PER ensures that periodic trends are still accounted for. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to improve the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER)... LML=-2224.904
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -2224.904)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: By modifying the kernel expression to use multiplication between RQ and PER, we can potentially capture interactions between the periodic nature of the data (PER) and the varying smoothness of the data (RQ). This combination may lead to a better fit compared to the original expression, as it allows the periodic structure to influence the rational quadratic behavior, possibly enhancing the overall flexibility of the kernel and improving the LML.

  Parent 2: ((RQ + SE) * PER) (LML: -3142.891)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + RQ) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by taking the sum of the SE and RQ kernels, which ensures smoothness and flexibility, and then multiplies it with the periodic kernel (PER). This allows the new kernel to capture both the smooth variations from the SE and RQ while also accounting for periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the parents.
  Result: ((SE + RQ) * PER)... LML=-2224.904
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + (RQ * PER)) (LML: -2137.716)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The current kernel combines the squared exponential with a product of the rational quadratic and periodic kernels, which may be overly complex for the data. By simplifying the kernel to just the sum of the squared exponential and periodic kernels, I aim to maintain flexibility while potentially improving the fit, as both kernels can capture different aspects of the data without the added complexity of the multiplication, which may not be necessary. This simpler expression could lead to a higher log marginal likelihood by reducing overfitting.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the SE kernel with a product of RQ and PER. The rationale behind this design is to leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel while also incorporating the periodic behavior of PER and the flexibility of RQ. By allowing RQ to modulate PER, we can capture more complex patterns in the data than either of the parent kernels individually, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE + (RQ * PER))... LML=-2137.716
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + PER) (LML: -1010.139)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ)
Analysis: The Squared Exponential (SE) kernel captures smoothness in the data, while the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel provides flexibility to model varying lengths of correlation. By multiplying these two kernels, we can leverage their strengths, allowing for both smooth and variable structures in the data. This combination may enhance the fit and potentially yield a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel.

    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of SE, while leveraging the flexibility of RQ to capture varying scales of data. By multiplying the sum of SE and PER with RQ, we enhance the model's ability to fit data with both smooth and periodic components, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels. This structure maintains a depth of 3 and balances the contributions of both parent kernels effectively.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 1, which captures both smoothness (from SE) and periodicity (from PER), with the scaling effect of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. By multiplying the summed kernels with RQ, we allow for varying length scales while maintaining the combined features of period and smoothness. This structure keeps the depth at 3 and is likely to enhance the fit by leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 1, which captures both smoothness from the SE kernel and periodicity from the PER kernel, with the flexibility of the RQ kernel that can model varying length scales. By multiplying the additive combination with the RQ kernel, we leverage the strengths of both parents while potentially improving the fit to the data, aiming for a higher LML than either parent.

  Parent 2: ((SE + RQ) * PER) (LML: -2224.904)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the squared exponential (SE) with a product of the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels. By incorporating the periodic component in conjunction with the rational quadratic, we aim to capture both smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data. This formulation retains the flexibility of the parent kernels while potentially improving the fit, as it introduces additional variability from the RQ, which was not present in the first parent kernel. The structure remains within the specified depth limit of 3.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * (PER + SE)
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the features of both parent kernels by leveraging the addition of the SE and RQ base kernels, which can capture smooth variations, and then multiplying this sum by a modified version of the periodic kernel (PER + SE). This construction aims to enhance the model's ability to fit periodic patterns while still benefiting from the smoothness provided by the SE and RQ kernels, potentially improving the LML by balancing both smooth and periodic characteristics.

By multiplying these two kernels, we can capture both smoothness and variability in the data, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood (LML) over the current kernel. This new expression maintains the required depth and leverages the strengths of both base kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the additive strengths of the well-performing (SE + PER) with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, which can capture varying scales in the data. By multiplying the additive kernel with RQ, it introduces a modulating factor that could potentially enhance the fit to the observed data while remaining within the depth limit.
