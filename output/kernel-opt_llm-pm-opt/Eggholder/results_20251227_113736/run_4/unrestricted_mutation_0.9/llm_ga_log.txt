  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (SE * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic structure from the first parent with the rational quadratic behavior, allowing for flexibility in capturing both periodic and varying smoothness in the data. The addition of the SE component provides an additional layer of smoothness, which could help improve the fit to the observed data and potentially achieve a higher LML by leveraging the strengths of different kernel behaviors.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -2949.699)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ + SE) * PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the rational quadratic (RQ) and squared exponential (SE) kernels with a periodic (PER) kernel. The RQ and SE components can capture varying length scales and smoothness in the data, while the multiplication with PER allows the model to incorporate periodicity in the underlying function. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels by allowing for complex patterns that exhibit both smooth changes and periodic behavior, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood (LML).

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -2949.699)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER) * RQ  
Analysis: The current kernel uses a product of periodic kernels, which may not capture the smoothness of the data effectively. By replacing the double periodic kernel with the squared exponential (SE) kernel, which provides better modeling of smooth variations in the data, and keeping the rational quadratic (RQ) kernel, which can capture varying length scales, we can potentially improve the model's flexibility and fit, leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((RQ + SE) * (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness and flexibility of the RQ and SE kernels with the periodicity of the PER kernel. By using the multiplication operator, we aim to capture both the varying scales from the RQ and SE components while also modeling the periodic structure from the PER kernel. This hybrid approach may leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to a better fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + PER) * RQ (LML: -2607.000)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: By using multiplication between the SE and RQ kernels, we can capture both smoothness and varying length scales more effectively, potentially leading to better fitting of the data. Adding the PER kernel allows for the incorporation of periodic behavior, which might improve the overall LML if there are periodic patterns in the observed data. This modification focuses on leveraging the strengths of the kernels more directly, likely enhancing the model's expressiveness and fitting capabilities.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the squared exponential (SE) with the periodicity of (PER) and utilizes the rational quadratic (RQ) to better model variability. By multiplying the periodic component with RQ, we may capture both periodic behavior and varying lengths scales, while the addition of SE allows us to account for general smoothness. This compound structure aims to harness the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially leading to improved fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:

Analysis: By switching the multiplication and addition, we allow the combination of the squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels to capture smoother variations (due to SE and RQ) while still incorporating periodicity through PER. This adjustment can help model the underlying data structure more effectively, potentially leading to a higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) with the periodicity of the Periodic (PER) kernel, while also leveraging the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. By using (SE + PER), we can capture both continuous and periodic behaviors, and by multiplying this with (PER * RQ), we aim to enhance the kernel's ability to model complex data patterns that exhibit both periodicity and varying smoothness. This combined structure seeks to harness the strengths of both parent kernels to optimize the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((SE + PER) * (PER * RQ))... LML=-3425.511

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + PER) * RQ (LML: -2607.000)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: SE + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: By moving the periodic kernel (PER) to interact with the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) first, we can capture both periodic variations and varying lengths of correlations more effectively. The addition of the squared exponential kernel (SE) then allows us to model smooth variations in the data. This modification could better fit the underlying patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the flexibility of the squared exponential (SE) and periodic (PER) components from Parent 1 with the multiplicative structure of the periodic kernel from Parent 2. By using (SE + PER), we ensure that we capture smooth variations from SE and cyclic patterns from PER. The multiplication with (PER * RQ) allows us to introduce varying scales of the periodicity, which can adapt to complex patterns in the data while maintaining a rational quadratic behavior that can model non-stationarity. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels to potentially yield a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ) + SE
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the effective characteristics of both parent kernels. By retaining the structure of (SE + PER) * RQ, which captures smoothness, periodicity, and varying length-scales, and adding SE, we introduce an additional layer of flexibility to model the data. The SE component allows for capturing local variations better, which might lead to a higher LML by improving the fit to the observed data. This combination leverages the strengths of both parents while potentially addressing their individual limitations.
  Result: ((SE + PER) * RQ) + SE... LML=-4682.036
  Kernel depth: 4

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + PER) * RQ (LML: -2607.000)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + PER
Analysis: By prioritizing the product of the SE and RQ kernels, we can capture both smoothness and varying length scales in the data, which may lead to a better fit. Adding the periodic kernel (PER) as an additive component helps to account for any periodic patterns in the data. This combination aims to exploit interactions between smoothness and periodicity, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ) + (PER * PER)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the base kernels from Parent 1, which incorporates both the smoothness of the SE kernel and the periodicity of the PER kernel, while also enhancing it with the periodic structure from the kernel of Parent 2. By adding the product of PER with itself, we introduce a stronger periodic component that may help capture more complex periodic patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher LML.

Analysis: By multiplying the SE and RQ kernels, we can capture both the smoothness and varying length scales of the data more effectively. Adding the PER kernel afterward allows us to account for any periodic patterns present in the data. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of the SE and RQ kernels while still incorporating periodicity, which may lead to a better fit and higher LML.

  Parent 2: ((SE + PER) * (PER * RQ)) (LML: -3425.511)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by using the RQ kernel's ability to model varying length scales (through multiplication with SE) while also incorporating periodic behavior (PER). The addition of (PER * RQ) allows the model to capture periodic fluctuations alongside the overall smoothness provided by the SE * RQ term. This combination aims to leverage the smoothness and flexibility of the RQ kernel with periodic patterns, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML than either parent.
  Result: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)... LML=-4590.587

Mutation:
  Current best: (SE + PER) * RQ (LML: -2607.000)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By modifying the kernel to multiply the periodic kernel (PER) by the rational quadratic kernel (RQ) before adding it to the squared exponential kernel (SE), we allow for the periodic component to be scaled in accordance with the variability modeled by the RQ kernel. This change may enhance the flexibility of the model, potentially improving the fit to the data and resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By combining the strengths of both parent kernels, this new kernel utilizes the SE and PER combination to capture smooth variations and periodic patterns, while also multiplying with the periodic kernel scaled by the rational quadratic kernel. This should allow for a more flexible fit that can accommodate both smoothness and periodicity in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.

Analysis: By multiplying the SE and RQ kernels, we leverage the smoothness of the RBF kernel while allowing for varying scales of correlation through the RQ kernel. Adding the PER kernel afterward introduces periodicity to the overall kernel, which can capture any oscillatory patterns in the data. This combination may provide a better fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic behavior from the first parent, which captures any cyclic patterns in the data, with the smoothness of the squared exponential kernel and the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel from the second parent. By incorporating SE, we introduce additional smoothness which can improve fitting to the overall trend in the data. The multiplication of PER and RQ allows us to retain the ability to model multiple length scales while still addressing periodicity, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By separating the multiplicative interaction between the SE and RQ kernels, we allow the model to capture a more flexible structure that combines the smoothness of SE with the varying length-scales of RQ. Adding the periodic kernel PER afterwards can capture any periodic variations in the data independently, potentially leading to a better fit and thus a higher LML.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the squared exponential (SE) with the periodicity of the periodic kernel (PER), while also leveraging the flexibility of the rational quadratic (RQ) kernel. By multiplying the periodic kernel with the rational quadratic, we introduce more variations that can capture periodic patterns in the data. The addition of the SE kernel provides a smooth baseline, which might enhance the overall fit and potentially lead to a higher log marginal likelihood than the parent kernels.

By adding the two components together, we can potentially leverage both the generality of the first parent's structure and the specific periodic detail of the second parent's construction, thereby aiming for a higher LML through improved fit to the observed data.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) with the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ), while also incorporating the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel. By using both (SE * RQ) and (PER * RQ), we aim to leverage the strengths of each parent kernel. SE provides a smooth and continuous fit, while PER captures periodic patterns, and RQ allows for varying smoothness.

Additionally, it retains the periodic structure from the second parent kernel while allowing it to interact multiplicatively with RQ to capture more complex patterns in the data. This combination aims to balance the generalization capabilities of both the SE and RQ kernels with the periodicity of the PER kernel, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by leveraging the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel while also incorporating the periodic behavior of the PER kernel. By using both (SE * RQ) and (PER * RQ), we can capture both the local variations and periodic trends in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood than either parent individually.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, while also incorporating the periodic structure provided by the PER kernel squared. The multiplication of PER by itself emphasizes periodicity, and by adding the SE * RQ component, we seek to capture both local and global variations in the data. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of the first parent kernel (which captures smoothness and periodicity) while also integrating the periodicity strength from the second parent, potentially improving the LML score.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the strengths of the two parent kernels by leveraging the effective smoothing properties of the SE kernel while allowing for the periodic behavior captured by the PER kernel. The term (SE * RQ) focuses on modeling varying length scales and capturing non-stationarity, while the term ((SE + PER) * PER) retains periodic characteristics.

Analysis: This kernel combines the flexibility of the squared exponential and periodic components with the rational quadratic kernel from Parent 1, while also incorporating the periodic structure with itself from Parent 2. By adding both parent kernels, we leverage the strengths of each to potentially capture a wider range of patterns in the data, which may lead to improved fit and higher log marginal likelihood.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((SE + PER) * RQ) (LML: -2607.000)
  Parent 2: SE * (PER + RQ) (LML: -2565.875)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * PER) + RQ  
Analysis: By taking the product of the SE and PER kernels, we can capture both the smoothness of the RBF kernel and the periodicity of the PER kernel, which may be beneficial for data with both characteristics. Adding the RQ kernel allows for additional flexibility in modeling varying degrees of smoothness, which should help to account for the residuals and improve the overall fit. This combination may better exploit the strengths of both parent kernels and thus potentially lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: (SE * PER) + RQ... LML=-4585.144
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: SE * (PER + RQ) (LML: -2565.875)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: SE * (RQ + PER)
Analysis: By changing the order of addition within the parentheses, this kernel places emphasis on the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel being combined with the Periodic (PER) kernel. The RQ kernel allows for varying smoothness, which can better capture local variations in the data, while still maintaining the periodicity from the PER kernel. This modification may help improve the fit to the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML).

  Parent 2: SE * (PER + RQ) (LML: -2565.875)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: SE * RQ * PER
Analysis: By multiplying all three base kernels together, we leverage the smoothness of the SE kernel, the varying length scales of the RQ kernel, and the periodicity of the PER kernel simultaneously. This combination allows the model to capture complex patterns in the data that might be missed when only combining two kernels. The increased flexibility may lead to an improved fit, potentially increasing the LML beyond that of the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER) * RQ  
Analysis: By combining the SE and PER kernels through addition, we can capture both smoothness and periodicity in the data more effectively. The product with the RQ kernel allows for flexibility in modeling varying degrees of smoothness, potentially improving the fit and increasing the log marginal likelihood. This modification aims to exploit the strengths of each kernel type in a complementary manner.

  Parent 2: (SE + PER) * RQ (LML: -2607.000)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE * RQ) + (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of the parent kernels by leveraging the squared exponential and rational quadratic components together, which can capture smoothness and varying length scales, while also including the periodic component with the rational quadratic kernel. By adding the two components, we allow for both smooth and periodic behavior in the data, potentially improving the model's flexibility and fit, which could lead to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the provided parent kernels.

Mutation:
  Current best: SE * RQ * PER (LML: -2070.623)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER) * RQ
Analysis: By combining the SE and PER kernels with addition first, we allow for both smoothness (from SE) and periodicity (from PER) to contribute to the model before multiplying by the RQ kernel, which can capture varying levels of smoothness. This modification aims to leverage both periodic and smooth components more effectively, potentially leading to a higher LML by better fitting the underlying structure of the data.

  Parent 2: SE * RQ * PER (LML: -2070.623)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: SE * (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the SE kernel, which captures smoothness, with a product of the PER and RQ kernels, allowing for both periodic behavior and flexibility in modeling varying length scales. By multiplying the PER and RQ kernels, we aim to leverage the strengths of both periodicity and scale variation without the potential overfitting that could arise from adding them linearly. This combination could result in better fitting to the observed data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than both parent kernels.
  Result: SE * (PER * RQ)... LML=-2070.623

Mutation:
  Current best: SE * (PER * RQ) (LML: -2070.623)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ) * PER
Analysis: By using addition between the SE and RQ kernels, we allow for more flexibility in modeling the variance while still maintaining the periodicity through the multiplication with the PER kernel. This combination can help capture both smooth variations (from SE) and varying scales (from RQ) while also accommodating periodic patterns, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML.

  Parent 2: SE * RQ * PER (LML: -2070.623)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: SE * (RQ + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the SE kernel with a sum of the RQ and PER kernels. By using addition, we allow for a richer representation of the data that captures both the long-range smoothness from the RQ kernel and the periodicity from the PER kernel. The SE kernel provides a smooth overall trend, while the interaction between RQ and PER can address different patterns in the data, potentially leading to an improved log marginal likelihood compared to the individual parent kernels.
  Result: SE * (RQ + PER)... LML=-2565.875
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: SE * (PER * RQ) (LML: -2070.623)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By changing the multiplication of the SE kernel with the entire periodic and rational quadratic combination to an addition, we allow for potential flexibility in capturing both smooth variations from the SE kernel and periodic/rational behaviors from the combined periodic and rational quadratic kernels. This adjustment can enhance the model's ability to fit the data by enabling it to better capture both local smoothness and periodic patterns without overly constraining the fit.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: SE * (PER + RQ)
Analysis: This new kernel combines the periodic and rational quadratic kernels additively, allowing the model to capture both periodic patterns and varying smoothness characteristics in the data. By using the squared exponential kernel as a multiplicative base, we ensure a smooth overall structure while enhancing the model's flexibility to adapt to the underlying data patterns, which may lead to an improved log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

Analysis: By changing the multiplication operation to addition between the SE and the product of the PER and RQ kernels, we allow for more flexibility in capturing variations in the data. This change may help to improve the model's fit to the data by allowing the influence of the SE kernel to coexist with the periodic and rational behaviors represented by the PER and RQ kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By combining RQ and PER using addition, we allow the kernel to capture both the smoothness and periodicity in the data, which can enhance the model's flexibility and expressiveness. This new kernel expression retains the effect of the SE kernel's smoothness while introducing variations from both periodic and rational quadratic behaviors, potentially leading to an improved fit and a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).
