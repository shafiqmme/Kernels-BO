Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  Parent 2: (RQ * (RQ + SE)) (LML: -4429.113)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the first parent with the flexibility of the rational quadratic kernel from the second parent. By multiplying the periodic kernel with a rational quadratic and then adding it to itself, we aim to capture the periodic variations while allowing for non-stationary behavior. This approach leverages the strengths of both parents, potentially improving the fit and increasing the log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * SE))... LML=-3486.457
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Periodic (PER) kernel, we introduce smoothness and periodicity into the model. The SE kernel captures continuous variation, while the PER kernel accounts for periodic trends, which may better adapt to the underlying structure of the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). This simplified expression also adheres to the depth constraint of 2.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * (SE + PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By multiplying PER with the sum of SE and PER, we leverage the strengths of both kernels while ensuring that the resulting kernel retains periodic characteristics, which could improve the fit to the observed data compared to the parent kernels. This structure also stays within the depth limit of 3 and aims to provide a better LML score by balancing the smoothness and periodicity in the data.
  Result: (PER * (SE + PER))... LML=-2543.217
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel, moderated by the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. This combination can capture a wider range of patterns in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and higher log marginal likelihood compared to the original kernel, which may be overly reliant on the periodicity of PER.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of both instances of the PER kernel from Parent 1 with the smoothness of the SE kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel from Parent 2. By using addition and multiplication, this expression aims to leverage the strengths of the periodic patterns while also incorporating smooth variations, potentially improving the fit to the observed data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By using the addition of SE and PER, we capture both smooth and periodic behaviors, while multiplying by PER allows us to emphasize the periodic structure, which may enhance the model's fit to periodic data. This construction maintains the depth constraint and leverages the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This expression combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel and the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. The addition of SE provides a robust baseline that can enhance the overall fit to the data, while the interaction between PER and RQ captures both periodic and varying smoothness characteristics, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the original kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the additive structure of Parent 1, which captures both smoothness (SE) and periodicity (PER), with the multiplicative nature of RQ, which allows for varying length scales. The combination aims to leverage the strengths of both smooth and periodic behaviors while introducing variability in the length scale through RQ, potentially improving the fit to the data and leading to a higher LML.
  Result: ((SE + PER) * RQ)... LML=-2607.000
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Periodic (PER) kernel through addition. The SE kernel provides smoothness and generalization across the input space, while the PER kernel captures periodic behaviors. This combination is likely to enhance the model's flexibility and fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel expression.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential kernel (SE) with a product of the periodic kernel (PER) and the rational quadratic kernel (RQ). By adding SE, which captures smoothness, to the interaction of PER and RQ, this expression aims to leverage the strengths of both periodic behavior and varying length scales from RQ. This combination may enhance flexibility and capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood than either parent kernel.

This combination allows for capturing both local variations (SE) and periodic patterns (PER) while accounting for changes in length scales (RQ). This diversity in kernel design should enhance the model's ability to fit the data, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic characteristics from Parent 1, which is already showing some potential with the term (PER * PER), while also integrating the smoothness from the squared exponential (SE) in a way that interacts with the periodic kernel. The addition of SE aims to enhance the expressiveness of the kernel, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data than either parent alone, which could lead to a higher log marginal likelihood.
  Result: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))... LML=-1654.663

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the squared exponential (SE) with the periodic nature of the periodic kernel (PER). By replacing one instance of PER with SE, we introduce more flexibility and a smoother fit to the data, which may help in achieving a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The multiplication of PER with itself captures periodicity, while the addition of SE allows for more adaptability in the overall shape of the kernel function. This combination may enhance the kernel's ability to model the observed data effectively.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression retains the structure of Parent 2, which already combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel with a product of periodic (PER) kernels, potentially capturing both smoothness from SE and periodicity from PER. The addition of SE may help improve model flexibility, while the product of PER kernels enhances the periodic component. Given that Parent 2 had a significantly lower LML score, leveraging its structure with an emphasis on the SE kernel, which typically provides better fit for continuous data, may help achieve a better LML.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic behavior of the PER kernel and the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. By adding an SE component, we can capture overall trends and smooth variations, while the PER * RQ component allows for capturing periodic behaviors with varying amplitude and length scales. This combination is likely to improve the fit to the data and thus increase the log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression is directly taken from Parent 1, which already has a better LML score compared to Parent 2. By retaining the squared exponential (SE) kernel, which captures smooth variations, and the product of periodic kernels (PER * PER), we maintain the periodic structure while avoiding the less favorable combinations present in Parent 2. This combination aims to leverage the strengths seen in Parent 1 while staying within the depth constraint.

Analysis: By introducing the SE kernel, which is known for its smoothness and flexibility, we can enhance the model's ability to capture variations in the data. The combination of SE with the periodic behavior captured by (PER * RQ) allows for both smooth trends and periodic patterns, potentially improving the fit and maximizing the log marginal likelihood compared to the original kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (SE * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression directly combines the periodic characteristics from Parent 1 with the added flexibility of the SE kernel, which is expected to capture smooth variations in the data effectively. Since Parent 1 had a lower LML score, maintaining its structure while incorporating the periodicity aspect, as seen in Parent 2, could help explore a better fit and potentially achieve a higher LML.

  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Periodic (PER) kernel, we can capture both smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data. SE provides a good fit for continuous data trends, while PER accounts for cyclical behaviors. This combination is more versatile and is likely to improve the fit, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * SE) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By using multiplication, we introduce a modulation effect (PER * SE) that retains the periodic structure while enhancing the overall flexibility of the kernel through the addition of the PER component. This approach aims to capture both periodic and smooth behaviors, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood compared to both parent kernels.

  Result: ((SE + PER) * PER)... LML=-2551.009
  Kernel depth: 3

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The squared exponential (SE) kernel is known for its smoothness and ability to capture general trends in data, while the periodic (PER) kernel captures periodic patterns. By combining them via addition, we can model both smooth trends and periodic variations in the data, which may result in a better fit and potentially higher log marginal likelihood compared to the current kernel expression.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  Parent 2: (SE + PER) (LML: -1472.744)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + SE)
Analysis: This expression combines the periodic characteristics of Parent 1 with the smoothness of the squared exponential from Parent 2. The multiplication of the periodic kernel with itself retains the periodicity while enhancing the variance, and adding the SE kernel introduces a smooth component that can help model data with trends. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels and potentially improve the log marginal likelihood by introducing additional flexibility.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By introducing the SE kernel into the expression, we can improve the flexibility of the model to capture smooth variations in the data while still utilizing the periodic nature of the PER kernel. The multiplication with RQ allows for capturing variations that may not be purely periodic, which can enhance the overall fit to the data and potentially increase the log marginal likelihood (LML). This combination aims to balance both smoothness and periodicity, possibly leading to a better model performance.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel, known for its smoothness and flexibility, with the periodic (PER) kernel, which captures periodic patterns. By simplifying the parent kernels and avoiding excessive complexity, this new expression aims to leverage the advantages of both kernels while keeping the depth within the limit. The combination should enhance the model's ability to fit the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) than the provided parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + SE)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic structure of Parent 1 with the smoothness of the squared exponential from Parent 2. By adding the SE kernel to the combination of two PER kernels, we maintain flexibility in capturing periodic patterns while also introducing a smooth component that can help improve the overall fit to the data, potentially increasing the LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The squared exponential (SE) kernel provides smoothness and is capable of capturing variations in the data effectively. By adding the periodic (PER) kernel, we can model any periodic behavior in the data without the complexity of squaring or multiplying the periodic kernel. This combination (depth 2) is likely to improve the log marginal likelihood by leveraging the strengths of both kernels while maintaining simplicity and flexibility.

  Parent 2: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -1312.696)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((SE + PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the strengths of both parent kernels by using the addition of the SE and PER kernels, which captures both smoothness and periodicity, and then multiplying by the RQ kernel. The RQ kernel allows for varying length scales, which can help model more complex patterns and potentially improve the log marginal likelihood. By leveraging the additive nature of the first parent and enhancing it with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, this expression maintains a depth of 3 while aiming for a better fit to the observed data.

Analysis: The current kernel expression combines periodic kernels in a way that may lead to overfitting or redundancy, resulting in a lower LML. By using the squared exponential (SE) kernel in combination with the periodic (PER) kernel, we can capture both smooth variations and periodic behavior in the data. This combination should help improve the fit to the observed data, potentially resulting in a higher LML score.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * SE) + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By multiplying PER with SE, we introduce a structure that captures both periodicity and smooth variations. Adding PER again helps to maintain the periodic influence while potentially improving the model fit, leveraging the better-performing aspects of both parent kernels. This combination may lead to a higher LML by balancing the strengths of both periodicity and smoothness.

Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic nature of the PER kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. This expression introduces a level of variation that can better capture complex patterns in the data compared to the original kernel, which is heavily reliant on the periodic component. By allowing for both additive and multiplicative interactions between the SE and the combination of PER and RQ, this kernel may achieve a higher log marginal likelihood by better fitting the observed data.
