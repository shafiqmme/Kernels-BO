  Parent 2: ((PER + PER) + RQ) (LML: -4946.281)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By multiplying PER with RQ, we capture variations that incorporate periodicity while maintaining the ability to model non-stationary behavior. Adding an additional RQ kernel at the end allows for further flexibility in fitting the data, which could help improve the log marginal likelihood compared to both parent kernels. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both parents without exceeding the depth constraint.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity from both parents with the rational quadratic kernel to capture varying smoothness. It leverages the strengths of Parent 1's ability to model periodic behavior and Parent 2's interaction between periodic and rational characteristics, potentially improving the LML by incorporating more flexible variations from the combination of the two kernels. The structure maintains a depth of 3 while allowing for interactions that could better fit the observed data.

Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel and the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. By adding SE to the product of PER and RQ, we aim to capture both the periodic trends and smooth variations in the data, potentially leading to a better fit and a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) than the original kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (PER * PER))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, while also maintaining the contribution of the PER kernel when multiplied together. By using both multiplication and addition, we aim to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels, potentially improving the fit to the data and achieving a higher LML than the given scores. This expression remains within the depth constraint of 3.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + RQ)
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel, which is known for its smoothness and flexibility in fitting a wide range of functions, with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel, which can model varying length scales in the data. This combination may provide a better fit than the previous periodic kernels alone, especially if the data does not exhibit strong periodicity. The addition of SE can help capture local variations more effectively, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + (RQ * PER))
Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using both multiplication and addition, it aims to exploit the strengths of both parent kernels without exceeding the depth limit. The structure is simple and avoids deep nesting, which may help in achieving a better fit for the observed data and potentially higher LML.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This modified kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodicity of the PER kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By adding the SE kernel, we introduce a global smoothness that can improve the fit to the data, while still allowing for periodic behavior modulated by the RQ kernel. This combination is likely to enhance the model's ability to capture underlying patterns in the observed data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) score.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, allowing for both periodic behavior and varying smoothness. By avoiding the redundancy of combining PER with itself and focusing on the product with RQ, we aim to enhance the representation of both periodic and non-periodic features in the data, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -3204.602)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the squared exponential (SE) kernel with the product of the periodic (PER) and rational quadratic (RQ) kernels. The addition of the SE kernel allows for better modeling of smoothness in the data, while the product of PER and RQ captures periodic patterns and varying smoothness. This combination is expected to enhance flexibility and may improve the log marginal likelihood over the current kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * RQ) + RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior (PER) with the rational quadratic (RQ) to capture both smoothness and periodic trends. By adding a direct contribution from the RQ kernel, the influence of the rational quadratic nature can enhance flexibility and accommodate variations in the data that neither parent kernel fully captures. This structure maintains a depth of 2 and is designed to leverage the strengths of both parent kernels while potentially achieving a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * RQ) + (SE * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By including the SE kernel alongside the product of PER and RQ, we introduce smoothness to the model, which might help capture variations in the data that are not purely periodic or rational. This combination could lead to a better fit, maximizing the log marginal likelihood by leveraging the strengths of both periodicity and smoothness.

Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic structure of the Periodic (PER) kernel and the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel. The addition of SE is likely to enhance the overall smoothness and improve the fit to the data, while the interaction between PER and RQ captures both periodic and varying degrees of smoothness. This modification aims to balance the strengths of different kernel types, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to the original kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * RQ) + (SE * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the flexibility of the RQ kernel, while also integrating the SE kernel to add smoothness. By adding the interaction of PER with RQ and the SE with PER, we leverage the periodic characteristics and the adaptability of the rational quadratic kernel, potentially improving the fit to the observed data and increasing the LML. This structure remains within the depth limit of 3.

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) * RQ) (LML: -3204.602)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: By introducing the SE kernel, we allow for a smooth variation in the function, which can capture the overall trend in the data, while still retaining the periodicity and long-range dependencies from the PER and RQ kernels. This combination may provide a better fit to the data by leveraging the strengths of each kernel, potentially leading to a higher LML than the original compound kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (PER * RQ) + ((PER * PER) * RQ)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the two parent kernels while still leveraging the rational quadratic kernel for additional flexibility. By adding the product of the periodic kernel with itself (which captures a more complex periodic structure) to the product of the periodic and rational quadratic kernels, we enhance the model's capacity to fit data with both periodic and varying smoothness characteristics. This combination aims to exploit the strengths of both parents while adhering to the depth constraint.

Analysis: The addition of the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel to the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel introduces an ability to model varying smoothness in the data. While SE provides a smooth function, RQ adds flexibility to capture more complex patterns. This combination can improve the fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) score compared to using SE alone.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + ((PER * PER) * RQ))
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) with the periodic characteristics of the periodic kernel (PER) while also incorporating the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic (RQ). By adding SE, we leverage its ability to fit smooth functions, which could improve the log marginal likelihood over the deeper, more complex expression of the second parent kernel. The synergy of these components should allow for capturing both smooth, continuous variations and periodic patterns in the data, thus potentially enhancing the overall fit.

Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Periodic (PER) kernel, we can capture both smooth variations due to SE and periodic patterns from PER. This hybrid approach may increase the flexibility of the model, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood (LML) score compared to using SE alone. The addition operation allows us to leverage the strengths of both kernels while maintaining a manageable complexity.

Analysis: By combining the strengths of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel, which captures smooth variations, with the Periodic (PER) kernel, which accounts for periodic behavior, the proposed kernel (SE * PER) is expected to model both variations and periodic patterns effectively. This combination may enhance the model's ability to fit the data better than the parent kernels, potentially resulting in a higher log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: By multiplying the SE kernel with the PER kernel, we combine the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodicity of the PER kernel. This interaction can potentially model patterns in the data that exhibit both smooth trends and periodic behavior, which might not be captured effectively by either kernel alone. Given that the addition of PER to SE resulted in a significant decrease in LML, this multiplicative approach may help to balance the contribution of each kernel, potentially leading to a better fit and higher LML.

Given that the LML of PER is relatively better than that of (SE + PER), the multiplication may enhance the overall flexibility and adaptability of the model while staying within the depth constraint.
  Result: (PER * SE)... LML=-4946.323
  Kernel depth: 2

Mutation:
  Current best: PER (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The addition of the SE kernel to the existing PER kernel introduces smoothness to the model, which can effectively capture variations in the data that the periodic kernel alone may not address. The SE kernel provides a flexible and continuous function, potentially improving the fit and increasing the log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the standalone periodic kernel.
  Result: (SE + PER)... LML=-1858.601
  Kernel depth: 2
