  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ + SE))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic structure from Parent 1 with the rational quadratic and squared exponential components from Parent 2. The expression retains the periodicity that may capture oscillatory patterns while also integrating the flexibility of the RQ and SE kernels for modeling smooth variations. The combination is likely to enhance the model's ability to fit the data by capturing both periodic and non-periodic variations, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + SE)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic characteristics of Parent 1 with the flexibility of the rational quadratic and squared exponential components from Parent 2. By maintaining the structure of the periodic kernel while introducing the adaptability of the rational quadratic and squared exponential, we can potentially capture both periodic patterns and varying smoothness in the data, which may lead to improved fitting and higher LML compared to the individual parent kernels.

  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * (RQ + SE))) (LML: -2269.440)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodicity from the first parent with the flexibility of the rational quadratic and the smoothness of the squared exponential from the second parent. By keeping the periodic kernel structure from Parent 1 and introducing the RQ and SE components, we aim to capture both local variations (through RQ) and smooth trends (through SE). This combination is expected to improve the fit to the data, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood compared to both parent kernels.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (PER * SE))
Analysis: This new kernel combines the periodic behavior of the first parent with the additional smoothness introduced by the RQ and SE components in the second parent. By multiplying PER with SE, we potentially capture more complex periodic patterns while retaining the flexibility of the RQ component, which can help improve the fit to the data and possibly achieve a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (PER * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity captured by the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel. By adding the term (PER * SE), we introduce an interaction that allows for both periodic behavior and smooth variations in the data, potentially leading to a better fit than either parent alone. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of the periodic kernel from Parent 2 while still incorporating the flexibility offered by the RQ and SE kernels from Parent 1.

Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Periodic (PER) kernel, we can capture both smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data. Multiplying this combination with the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel allows for more flexibility in modeling varying lengths of scale, which could lead to a better fit and potentially higher log marginal likelihood. This new expression leverages the strengths of multiple kernels to adapt to the observed data more effectively.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic nature of the (PER * PER) term from Parent 1 with the rational quadratic (RQ) and squared exponential (SE) from Parent 2. The inclusion of SE in conjunction with RQ may help capture smoother variations in the data, while still leveraging the periodic structure. By simplifying the complexity of Parent 2 and retaining the effective interactions from Parent 1, this kernel aims to balance flexibility and tractability, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood.

Mutation:

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: The proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic structure of the Periodic (PER) kernel, while also incorporating the interaction of the periodic kernel with itself. This modification is likely to capture both the smooth variations and periodic patterns in the data more effectively than the original kernel, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The SE kernel can help in smoothing out noise, while the (PER * PER) term retains the periodicity aspect, enhancing the overall model flexibility.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + ((PER * PER) + PER))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodicity features provided by the combination of the periodic kernels from Parent 2. By adding SE, which captures general trends and smooth variations, to the more complex periodic structure of ((PER * PER) + PER), we aim to leverage both the flexibility of periodic patterns and the overall smoothness, potentially improving the fit to the data and achieving a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). This combination introduces additional complexity while retaining the benefits of each parent kernel.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * (PER + RQ)))
Analysis: This kernel combines the successful additive structure of the first parent with a modification of the second parent by introducing the RQ kernel in a multiplicative context with the periodic component. By including RQ in the periodic structure, we aim to capture both smoothness and variability inherent in the data, potentially improving the LML over both parent kernels. The addition of SE ensures the kernel retains overall smoothness, which may address any shortcomings in fitting due to the periodic nature alone.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (PER * RQ))
Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the periodic behavior from both parents with the addition of the rational quadratic kernel to capture varying smoothness. By retaining the strong periodic structure from the first parent while introducing variability through the rational quadratic kernel, this expression aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels, potentially leading to improved fit and a higher log marginal likelihood.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: By combining the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the Periodic (PER) kernel, we allow for smooth variations in the data while also capturing periodic patterns. The SE kernel provides flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships, potentially improving the overall fit to the data compared to the current kernel, which may be too constrained with only periodic components. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both kernels to achieve a higher log marginal likelihood (LML).

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: ((PER * PER) + (RQ * SE))
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity captured by the squared periodic kernel from Parent 1 with the flexibility of the Rational Quadratic kernel and the smoothness of the Squared Exponential kernel from Parent 2. The combination aims to preserve the periodic structure while allowing for varying scales of smoothness, potentially improving the model's fit to the data and, consequently, maximizing the log marginal likelihood.

Analysis: This new kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel, while also incorporating the Rational Quadratic (RQ) kernel to capture varying length scales. By using (PER * RQ), we introduce a product that allows for both periodic variations and added flexibility in modeling the data, which may lead to a better fit and thus a higher log marginal likelihood (LML) compared to the parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic nature of the PER kernel. By adding a component from the first parent ((PER + PER)), we enhance the periodicity, while the SE kernel contributes flexibility and helps generalize well. The multiplication of PER with this combination retains the periodic characteristics while potentially improving the overall fit, which may lead to a higher LML than both parents.

Analysis: The first parent kernel already shows a relatively high LML score compared to the second parent. By maintaining the structure of the first parent, we utilize the periodic component effectively without adding the redundant terms present in the second parent. This kernel combines the smoothness of the squared exponential with the periodicity captured by the multiplication of the periodic kernels, potentially providing a better fit to the data without introducing unnecessary complexity that may lead to overfitting, as seen in the second parent’s much lower LML score.

  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + (PER * PER))
Analysis: The first parent kernel already has a better LML score than the second parent kernel. By keeping the structure of (SE + (PER * PER)), we leverage the effect of the periodic components while maintaining the smoothness of the squared exponential kernel. This structure should provide a good balance between capturing periodicity and overall smoothness, potentially leading to a higher LML value than either parent.

Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodicity captured by the (PER * PER) term, which can help model more complex periodic patterns in the data. By including an additional PER term, we can enhance the kernel's ability to capture local periodic fluctuations, potentially leading to a better fit and improved log marginal likelihood compared to the parent kernels.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines the smoothness of the SE kernel with the periodic structure of the PER kernel. By multiplying SE with PER, we introduce a smooth periodic behavior, which can capture more complex patterns. Additionally, including the original periodic term ((PER * PER) + PER) ensures that we retain the periodic characteristics from Parent 1, potentially enhancing flexibility and improving LML by accommodating both smooth and periodic variations in the data.

Crossover 1:
  Parent 1: (SE + (PER * PER)) (LML: -7.999)
  Parent 2: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the smoothness of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with the periodic nature of the Periodic (PER) kernel. By simplifying the interaction, we may capture both the underlying trends and periodic patterns in the data more effectively than the more complex structures of the parent kernels, potentially leading to a higher log marginal likelihood (LML). The addition of the SE kernel ensures that the model can adapt to changes in the data's overall shape, while the PER kernel captures any periodic behavior, thus optimizing the fit.
  Result: (SE + PER)... LML=-1858.601
  Kernel depth: 2

Mutation:
  Current best: ((PER * PER) + PER) (LML: -1.500)
  LLM Response:
    Kernel: (SE + PER)
Analysis: The original kernel is heavily reliant on the periodic kernel (PER), which may not adequately capture non-periodic variations in the data. By introducing the squared exponential kernel (SE), we can better model smooth variations while retaining periodicity. The combination of (SE + PER) allows for a more flexible fit, potentially improving the log marginal likelihood by accommodating both smooth trends and periodic patterns in the data.
  Result: (SE + PER)... LML=-1858.601
  Kernel depth: 2
