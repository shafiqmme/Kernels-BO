The periodic kernel captures cyclical patterns in the data, while the squared exponential kernel provides smoothness and local variation. By simplifying the combination and focusing on the core strengths of the parent kernels, this expression maintains a depth of 2 and may yield improved LML by emphasizing periodic behavior while ensuring smoothness. This approach avoids overcomplication that might arise from adding the rational quadratic kernel, which may not align as well with the periodic structure of the data.

This configuration may balance the strengths of both parent kernels and potentially lead to a better fit for the observed data, possibly improving the LML.

    Kernel: (SE * PER) + (RQ * PER)
Analysis: This kernel combines the periodic behavior of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By taking the product of SE with PER, we incorporate the periodicity while maintaining smooth transitions. The addition of RQ multiplied by PER allows for capturing variations in the data that may not be purely periodic, potentially leading to better overall model fit and a higher LML than either parent. This structure keeps the depth at 2, ensuring it remains simple yet effective.

Analysis: This kernel retains the structure of Parent 1, which combines the characteristics of the SE and RQ kernels and modulates them with the periodic kernel (PER). Given that Parent 1 has a higher LML than Parent 2, I believe this combination can leverage the smoothness from the SE kernel, the flexibility from the RQ kernel, and the periodicity from the PER kernel to potentially achieve a better fit to the data. By keeping the existing structure, we can explore the same parameter space while aiming for improved optimization in the LML.

Analysis: This kernel expression combines the periodic nature of the PER kernel with the smoothness of the SE kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel. By using PER in both terms, we aim to capture periodic behavior while maintaining a smooth structure with SE. This approach may lead to improved fit for data exhibiting periodic patterns, potentially increasing the log marginal likelihood by leveraging the strengths of both parent kernels.

Analysis: This kernel expression maintains the structure of Parent 1, which already incorporates the periodic behavior of PER while allowing for the flexibility of both SE and RQ in modeling the data. Since Parent 1 has a higher LML than Parent 2, I propose keeping this structure as is while exploring possible tweaks in parameters to potentially increase the LML further.

Analysis: This kernel combines the periodicity from the PER kernel with the smoothness from the SE kernel and the flexibility of the RQ kernel.

Analysis: This proposed kernel combines aspects of both parent kernels by using the SE kernel in a multiplicative combination with both the PER and RQ kernels. By allowing the SE kernel to modulate the influence of the periodicity (PER) and the rational quadratic behavior (RQ), this expression aims to capture both smooth variations and periodic patterns, potentially improving the fit to the data and maximizing the log marginal likelihood. The choice of addition allows for the exploitation of the strengths of both kernels while maintaining the depth constraint.

By simplifying the kernel to combine the squared exponential with the rational quadratic kernel, we can capture variability in the data while maintaining smoothness. This combination often results in a better fit, especially if the data exhibits both smooth trends (captured by SE) and varying lengths of scale (captured by RQ).
